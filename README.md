stuyspectator-archive
=====================

## What the *hell* is this?!

This, my friends, is an **Archive of the 20GB~ that made our old website.** It's scarry. You don't want to look in here.

It has everything the old micfo ftp had on it. This was stuyspectator.com for 13 years.

## The Files
This repo is about 27gb of fun. I do not reccomend cloning this thing, and I definitely do not think you should download the zip archive. Disaster awaits.

### How to Get Files
First â€” why do you want files from here? Think deeply. Take a walk. Do you really want any of this?
If you answer yes, fine. You will not want all the files from here. 

To get a specific file, use 
`git archive --remote=https://github.com/stuyspec/stuyspectator-archive.git HEAD:path/to/directory filename | tar -x`
That will save a copy of `'filename'` from the `HEAD` of the remote repository in the current directory.

The :path/to/directory part is optional. If excluded, the fetched file will be saved to <current working dir>/path/to/directory/filename.

### Is this really everything?

No. We're missing a few files due to the 100mb limit on uploads put in place by github.

What's missing:
- /application_backups/4lrIFs_files/core
- /public_html/audio/Culture Fest.wmv
- /public_html/mail/core
- /public_html/wp-content/backup-eec9d/stuyspec_tator_wp_20130219_219.sql

### What do I do with this?

My advice? Leave it alone. Never touch it unless you need an old image or something. Just stay away.

Enjoy the new website.


Cheers.
