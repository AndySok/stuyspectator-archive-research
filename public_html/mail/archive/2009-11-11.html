<b>Teachers Taught How To Implement Writing Across the Curriculum</b><br />
During the students' day off on Tuesday, November 3, Martha Harbison, editor of Popular Science magazine, talked to Stuyvesant staff about her experiences as both a scientist and a writer, and gave suggestions as to how Writing Across the Curriculum should be properly implemented in classes.

United Federation of Teachers: the Teachers' Union</b><br />
The United Federation of Teachers (UFT) was established in 1960 as the New York City chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, the national teachers' union. Teachers in the fifties and early sixties were often overworked, underpaid and subject to what some teachers termed the tyrannical power of principals and other supervisory staff.<br />

Who knew the Department of Education's (DOE) ban on bake sales were affecting the health of Stuyvesant's mice?<br />

<b>Of Leif Ericson and Lost Moments</b><br />
Christopher Columbus (whom many people believe don't deserve the holiday) should be lucky that he is still being discussed these days. People like Leif Ericson (who is honored on October 9) have done so much more than Columbus and are overlooked.<br />

<b>Missing the Dot</b><br />
Students already carry a large amount of stress with juggling homework, class work, tests and a social life. The majority of us do try our best to make it on time, but it's about time for Stuyvesant to realize that it's okay if we don't always make it on the dot.<br />

<b>Point: Fear of a Rap Planet</b><br />
Yes, many people dislike rap because its violent and crude. However, these days, much rap music is neither. So let's not judge a song by its genre, shall we?<br />

Remember Superpoke and Superlatives? No? If you don't, it might be because new apps such as Farmville, Pet Society or quizzes that are outrageous and surprisingly accurate are taking over.<br />

<b>Academics Instead of Sports</b><br />
Every Stuyvesant student is stressed by the amount of homework, tests and papers they have to do. Is playing sports adding to the stress? Athletes find AIS tutoring to be a lot of help when they need to catch up in class.<br />
