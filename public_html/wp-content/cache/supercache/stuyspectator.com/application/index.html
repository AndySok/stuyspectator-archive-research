<p>96 years. As a publication for the students, by the students, The Spectator depends on the participation of an active</p>
<p>staff, who are admitted to each department based on a written application.</p>
<p>Listed below are the applications for each of the Spectator&#8217;s 12 departments. You may apply to as many departments</p>
<p>as you like, but you must submit a separate application for each one. As several questions are common to each</p>
<p>department&#8217;s application, we advise that you save your responses in a word document so that you not only have a copy</p>
<p>for your records, but so that you may reuse answers where appropriate. No late applications will be accepted. In order to apply to a department click on its name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Applications due dates vary by department. Email the respective department to ask when applications are due!</strong></p>
<p><a title="Art" href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/art-2" >Art</a></p>
<p>Art influences almost all aspects of The Spectator by giving articles a creative “face.” We’re also looking for the</p>
<p>Stuyvesant artists who like to express themselves though comics or get their opinions across in op-art. Draw your own</p>
<p>take on the articles printed in The Spectator and get the opportunity to have the entire Stuyvesant community see your</p>
<p>great work.</p>
<p><a title="Arts and Entertainment" href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/arts-and-entertainment-2" >Arts and Entertainment</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever read a great book, listened to a breathtaking song, or stopped to take a better</p>
<p>look at a striking work of art, you&#8217;ve done what we do. As the Spectator&#8217;s department of Arts and Entertainment, a</p>
<p>lot falls under our jurisdiction. From reviewing the delectable cuisine at events such as the Taste of Tribeca, covering</p>
<p>red carpet premiers at the Tribeca Film Festival, and more, our scope is far from narrow. Though we give events in</p>
<p>Tribeca priority, our reach spans all over the city. Ultimately, it is our duty to bring the city&#8217;s culture to the Stuyvesant</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><a title="Business" href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/business" >Business</a></p>
<p>The Business Department is looking for talented and persuasive people to sell advertising space in The</p>
<p>Spectator! Join is if you are interested in sales, want to hone your people skills, or just like the adrenaline rush that</p>
<p>comes from pitching an idea to a client. No experience is necessary, but if you are a people-person, this job is for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/web/" >Web</a></p>
<p>Web is the future of newspapers. It allows for Spectator articles to be read whenever, wherever, and by</p>
<p>whomever, thus helping the newspaper reach a wider audience. As a member of the Web Department, you will help</p>
<p>update the site to reflect what you think is most important, and make videos to accompany articles.</p>
<p><a title="Copy" href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/copy" >Copy</a></p>
<p>Think you are a grammar whiz? The Copy Department may be the place for you! Members get an exclusive</p>
<p>first look at all Spectator articles, reading and correcting them just before printing time. Whether you are looking to</p>
<p>touch up on SAT vocabulary and grammar, develop your essay skills, or just have a knack for grammar, the Copy</p>
<p>Department is sure to improve your proofreading abilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/features" >Features</a></p>
<p>The close cousin of News, which covers distinct events, Features covers trends and broader ideas. Profiles of</p>
<p>teachers, students, clubs and organizations fall under the umbrella of Features writing, as do investigative reports and</p>
<p>coverage of trends in student and faculty opinion. News provides the hard facts, but Features provides the back-story</p>
<p>and the analysis, and ultimately aims to give greater insight into the issues that affect Stuyvesant students every day.</p>
<p>Writers have great freedom to choose what they want to cover.</p>
<p><a title="Humor" href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/humor" >Humor</a></p>
<p>The Humor Department specializes in what some would call &#8220;fake news&#8221; and other, more informed people</p>
<p>might call &#8220;valuable and indispensable journalism.&#8221; We are also known as &#8220;Slander and Libel,&#8221; named after the</p>
<p>morally questionable means we go about obtaining our quotes. If you are funny, have an affinity for writing, and enjoy</p>
<p>publications such as The Onion, the Humor Section is for you.</p>
<p><a title="Layout" href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/layout" >Layout</a></p>
<p>The Layout Department is in charge of putting the paper together. We are the link between the cyber world</p>
<p>of text and the tangible publication you pick up every other week. Members of Layout will learn about the art of</p>
<p>organizing and laying out a mistake-free paper. They will also be taught to view the paper critically.</p>
<p><a title="News" href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/news" >News</a></p>
<p>“ Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Why read all about it when you can write all about it (and potentially have</p>
<p>your name in bold on the front page for doing so)? As a staff writer of the News Department, you will be the first to</p>
<p>know about everything that goes on at Stuyvesant, and you will get to be the person who conveys that to the rest of</p>
<p>the student body. We cover everything from teams winning competitions to teachers being recognized for research to</p>
<p>administrators altering school policies to how budget cuts affect our students. You’ ll get to improve your reporting</p>
<p>skills as you talk to people inside and outside of the Stuyvesant community, and you’ ll have a chance to better your</p>
<p>writing as you learn to deliver the facts in a clear, direct, interesting fashion that News is recognized for. You know</p>
<p>what they say – you can’ t have a newspaper without the News&#8230;so join Spec News!</p>
<p><a href="http://stuyspectator.com/application/opinions" >Opinions</a></p>
<p>You have all found yourself in that moment where you stood patiently on the escalator, frozen in time,</p>
<p>contemplating the realities of your life, Stuyvesant, or the world at large. Perhaps you found yourself angered by</p>
<p>school policy or inspired by a novel, or had an urge to mutter a long-winded rant under your breath. The Spectator’s</p>
<p>Opinions Department can provide a venue for you to share your thoughts on absolutely any subject matter. Gives you</p>
<p>the freedom to write anything from a political argument to an account of a personal, intellectual journey. So, go on.</p>
<p>Join Opinions and don’t let all those points of view go unwritten.</p>
<p><a title="Photography" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y8xkM0kVzl8wGx2tduqQqDFLnfZzkFEprVkwBTW1wvE/viewform" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://docs.google.com']);">Photo</a></p>
<p>When you read the paper do you focus on the photos? Like making people look sharp? Want to widen your</p>
<p>field of view and have the opportunity to be exposed to events and establishments around the city? Are you looking to</p>
<p>develop your skills in photojournalism? If so, join Spec Photo!</p>
<p><a href=" http://stuyspectator.com/application/sports" >Sports</a></p>
<p>The Sports Department covers each of the 37 sports teams at Stuyvesant, including news about individual</p>
<p>teams and players, as well as new policies that affect Stuyvesant athletics. However, we also sometimes feature the</p>
<p>most important things around the professional sports world. The articles we write range from team previews at the</p>
<p>beginning of the season, team updates midway through the season, and finally, season recaps. We also write columns,</p>
<p>which are opinion pieces on anything to Stuyvesant sports, or even pressing issues in the professional sports world.</p>
<p>Finally, for those more interested in the personal level of the athletics scene, we write features on coaches, players or</p>
<p>alumni.</p>
