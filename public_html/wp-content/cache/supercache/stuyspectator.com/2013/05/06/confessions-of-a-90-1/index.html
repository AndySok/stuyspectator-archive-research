<p>With absolute apathy on his face, my math teacher looks around the classroom and mutters, “I graded your tests.” And the crowd goes wild. Tests matter far too much in this school. They decide what’s on your transcript, your transcript decides which college you get into, and that college decides how your life will unfold. I’m a freshman at Stuyvesant, and this insane pressure struck me the moment I entered the doors. I came from an environment that was less competitive and number-intensive, so the transition was more than an annoyance. Not only do students talk about grades all the time, but teachers, guidance counselors, and other administrators also put grades first and foremost. And they wonder why we’re stressed.</p>
<p>But at this moment—in this highly tense math class—my peers can’t contain themselves. Their expressions as the teacher passes out the tests resemble that of someone waiting to see if his tumor is benign. Some students sigh with relief, others do a brief victory dance, and most collapse in shame. One receives a 92, and a single tear rolls down his face. Seriously? I know this school is competitive, but dude, come on.</p>
<p>My test back has an 85 on it. That’s okay. Not good enough to brag, but not bad enough for a verbal whipping when I get home. The girl sitting next to me looks over at my paper and sends a small frown toward me with the words “I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>And I’m stunned. I don’t know what to say, so I tell her it’s okay, but now I look like a victim.</p>
<p>As I walk through the room, I see a flurry of numbers, all with big red 9s at the beginning, most of the students complaining about their amazing grades. It makes me feel strange to be satisfied with an 85. Stuyvesant students like to say that they aren’t the stereotype portrayed in the news, but the media gets the grade factor on the nose. We are obsessed with grades. The report card day can be Christmas or the Last Judgment, depending on who you are or how much you care. Somehow, my 85 is perceived as a bad grade.</p>
<p>That’s what I am now: an 85. An 85.4, to be exact. I don’t really care about math, so that shouldn’t matter to me since I’m getting decent grades in subjects I actually like, but the school wants the full package: someone capable of anything and everything. To Stuyvesant, I’m the sum of my parts, also known as student #2260 with an overall average of 90.1. Personal expression is dead to the school and test grades are what matter, because to the school, that’s who you are. Guidance counselors try to break up the number game by stressing the importance of extracurriculars, but they’re just expanding the game. The more extracurriculars you have, the more badges you can put on the Boy Scout vest that is your high school career.</p>
<p>Even past your senior year, you remain a number to the administration.  1224 were accepted into Johns Hopkins, 4592 into Harvard. Then the principal can display the admissions to show everyone that 1465 students with 97.2 averages got into the colleges of their choice. This, in my opinion, is the most disgusting part of the institution that is Stuyvesant: the theft of personality that is perpetrated by none other than the administration itself.</p>
<p>The school finds many ways to contribute to this mentality. College counselors tell smart, hardworking students with 94 averages that they probably won’t get into the colleges they want; most teachers consider an 88 a disappointing, if not outright bad, grade; and the administration expects nothing less than a 100 on each Regents exam. All of these factors come together to create an environment that causes nothing but brutal competition and stress, the main contributors to the infamous cheating that plagues the school.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my parents are grateful for my overall average of 90.1. But it’s hard for me to feel good about my grades when pretty much everyone else has  higher ones.</p>
<p>One lunch period, I proudly shared the 94 I worked incredibly hard for in English, only to have my friends dismiss the grade as “meh” and describe how they received 96s with astonishingly minimal amounts of effort. According to the administration, they’re better English students than I am. If they were to ask my English teacher, they might realize that I’m very committed to the subject and worked hard to earn my grade, but the undying number game prevents things like effort from coming into play.</p>
<p>But there are moments when I think that maybe there’s more to this school, and I see it in the people. I can walk up to pretty much any Stuyvesant student and break the ice with something about having too much homework or the math department being terrible. That kind of perpetual connection between the students is incredible, and it’s something you can’t find anywhere else. Gathering some of the smartest kids in the city together contributes to an intelligent, witty environment. Many students are brilliant, even when you look past academic prowess.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why there is an astonishingly low level of bullying in Stuyvesant. It’s a welcoming environment where literally anyone can fit in. Even if you’re not used to making friends, there are at least a couple of people in the same situation as you. Students from other schools complain about not finding anyone like them, but that’s nearly impossible at Stuyvesant. It’s just a very friendly school.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant is a rigid, strict, and almost pointless institution run by grades. But if you manage to look beyond the academics, you’ll find a wonderful school filled with equally wonderful people. No one I know hates his or her school more than Stuyvesant students hate Stuyvesant, yet for some reason no other students are as happy. The true heart of Stuyvesant doesn’t lie in its GPAs or stunning number of Intel finalists, but rather in the people who populate its hallways. As a 90.1, I can confidently say that I don’t like Stuyvesant, but I’m happy that I’m here.</p>

			<p>A 90.1 is perfectly acceptable. I got into everywhere I wanted minus the Ivies with an 89.4 so you likely will be able to do the same.</p>

			<p>hi, henry.</p>
<p>i graduated from stuy awhile ago and this struck me: &#8220;College counselors tell smart, hardworking students with 94 averages that they probably won’t get into the colleges they want&#8221; because by the time i was applying to college beginning of senior year, my average was around that figure and i was accepted early action to the college that i ended up attending. perhaps the times have changed that much, perhaps not.</p>
<p>i&#8217;d say that the pressure will annoy you as much as you let it annoy you, so just brush it off your shoulders. i&#8217;d put more weight to your hard-earned 94 than the easy-peasy 96 &#8212; that, to me, shows that they wasted potential. </p>
<p>i want to encourage you to keep striving &#8212; not so much to get as close as you can to 100 so you can be competitive, but because you stand to gain more. you may not get into the college you think you&#8217;re supposed to want to go to despite all the effort. but you might actually remember what you learned and enjoy the learning process, you&#8217;ll master how to retain what you learn. learn how to learn, not how to ace exams. </p>
<p>the work ethic and sense of excellence you&#8217;re developing now will benefit you beyond getting you into college; these skills/qualities will help you make the most of whatever opportunities that present themselves and more importantly, create opportunities.</p>
<p>i think it&#8217;s wise that you&#8217;re not hinging your happiness at stuy with the consensus of what defines success at stuy. </p>
<p>carry on.</p>

			<p>As a former Brooklyn Tech student, I went through very similar situations that were described in this article.  It outlines a problem with the education system that needs to be fixed.  There should be less emphasis on grades, because like the writer said, it strips students of their individuality.  As a specialized high school student who was constantly being asked about her grades, looked down upon for obtaining low 90&#8242;s, and constantly listened to the bragging and idolizing of perfect scores, I became depressed because I was not perceived as an individual, but as a number.</p>
<p>This article expresses an important idea that I think needs to be discussed more in society. Thank you for writing this.</p>

			<p>How cynical.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry if that was your experience. For myself, I found a world of difference between Brown and Stuy. Different schools have different cultures; painting them all with one brush is misleading.</p>

			<p>I question whether we can say what the administration thinks of someone that it pretty much never interacts with. The author talks about how the administration views him, but doesn&#8217;t actually interact with the administration. The author is right that college counselors encourage kids, even kids with solid averages, to apply to some lower tiers of schools, but that&#8217;s not because they are trying to insult you or they view you negatively, it&#8217;s because Stuy students&#8217; college lists are often short on safeties, and the college office is trying to ensure that people have a balanced college list. The author also laments that college statistics show kids as nothing but accepted/rejected with SAT scores and a GPA. But this data, you will find in your junior and senior year, is very helpful in figuring out how to put together a good list of colleges to apply to. The data only shows people&#8217;s grades and test scores, but that&#8217;s just because anything more would be a privacy violation!</p>
<p>Simply put, I see no credible reason put forward in this article to think that the administration only cares about you in proportion to your academic success; what I instead see is evidence that the Stuyvesant student body is grade obsessed and has unrealistic standards that some students can&#8217;t meet. Perhaps the administration should do something to alleviate this (Teitel did, for example, plan to cut the day to 9 periods to reduce stress, and the administration also has a policy limiting the number of APs you can take without a waiver, also aimed at stress reduction) but the problem is us, not them.</p>

			<p>You really need more years of experience and actual interactions with the administration before you can come to conclude this. It&#8217;s ironic that you use your 85 as an example of a low grade on the test that people are sorry for while, in reality, a lot of students get much lower. Also your claim that there&#8217;s no bullying at Stuyvesant is not true. While there is much less physical bullying/harassment, there is a lot of latent racism and subtle putdowns. The blatant mental health problems and feelings of entitlement are a whole other story. Please open your eyes.</p>

			<p>If you were wondering why your last school wasn&#8217;t as competitive or grade-oriented, it&#8217;s because it was middle school. You were 12. I don&#8217;t really understand what you want. Do you want your grades to be based on your &#8220;personal expression&#8221; and not your performance in class? Basing grades off of test scores is wrong? Do you want the administration to cuddle you  to sleep at night?</p>

			<p>Hi, Henry,</p>
<p>I know how you feel. When I went to Stuy (2004-2008) things were the same way. Like you, I felt disgusted by the Stuyvesant culture, which emphasized grades over curiosity, inquiry, and learning.</p>
<p>However, some of your statements are very vague. You speak about the &#8220;school&#8221; and the &#8220;administration&#8221; as if they were people. For example:</p>
<p>- &#8220;The school wants the full package.&#8221; Are you sure you don&#8217;t mean college admissions?</p>
<p>- &#8220;Personal expression is dead to the school.&#8221;  What does this mean, really?  In what ways would you like to see a greater emphasis on self-expression?</p>
<p>- &#8220;Most teachers consider an 88 a disappointing, if not outright bad, grade; and the administration expects nothing less than a 100 on each Regents exam.&#8221;  These are very strong claims.  What is your evidence for this?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, really. While I had many of the same complaints that you had, I found my frustration directed at other students &#8212; primarily the apathetic and grade-obsessed. I loved the institution that gave me so many opportunities to excel, provided an intellectually stimulating environment, etc. But the culture? Not so much.</p>
