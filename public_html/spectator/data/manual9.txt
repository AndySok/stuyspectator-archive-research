What is Art?<br>
<br>If you've ever had an idea for a cartoon, you can probably have many more. You'll find that after a certain point it becomes systematic, no longer a question of being able to think of one but of choosing the best one you've thought of. When done well, cartoons can be as strong and deep and true as a book. In addition, they're much shorter, have more pictures, and tend to be funnier. So kick ass. No one currently on the art staff has had any formal training. Here's a list of everything we've learned by experience:<br>
<br>
Meetings<br>
<br>Come to meetings. Their most important function is to remind you that the newspaper exists. They're a place to trade ideas  more often than not, I leave meetings knowing what I'm going to draw. Also, meetings are where group projects get started, and you don't want to be left out. <br>
<br>
Ideas and Cartoons<br><br>
Use your life as material.<br>
<br>There's no rule saying that The spectator cartoons have to take place in school, but they should tangentially relate to high school existence. i.e: don't write about 30-year-old millionaires on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange<br>
<br>
Be unusual.<br>
<br>A billion cartoons have been drawn about the fact that school food is bad and that students don't sleep. Trust me, I've read like, ALL of them. Beware the Cartoon That Compares Restrictive School Policies to Those Of A Fascist Police State. These have been done. So what are you supposed to do, stop writing about sleep depravation, questionable breakfast and your chemistry crush who always glances up when you've unbalanced an equation? Of course not. What else would you write about? But you have to tackle everything in a new way, because that's what cartoons are for.<br>
<br>
Don't use too many words...<br>
<br>I'm not saying you should use spare, minimalist prose  some strips are very verbal and that's great. Just make sure you don't have boring explanations that could be better indicated visually: If you have a car driving up to a menu with a walkie-talkie in it, no one has to say, "McDonald's Drive Thru, can I take your order?"<br>
<br>
...or too many frames. <br>
Remember the more frames you have, the less space you have for each one. By all means, use them if you need them, but make sure you do.<br>
<br>
Team up<br>
<br>This is so important I don't know why I let it wait until number five. If you have ideas but can't draw, find someone who can. If you're an artist with no ideas, offer your services. Some people are possessive and would rather do it all themselves, but team work is wonderful; it's the reason we have a staff. Anyway, it's about making good cartoons, not your stupid feelings.<br>
<br>
Find some way to draw hands. <br>
<br>They don't need to resemble actual hands to any degree. As long as they're expressive and your characters aren't afraid to use them.<br>
<br>
When in doubt, ask everyone. <br>
<br>If you're juggling two lines and wondering which is funnier, if you don't know if a drawing is clear or whether something is offensive, ask someone. Remember, your goal is to make a cartoon that people will like. If you disagree with this goal, that's fine, your cartoons will die by natural selection because the art editor, a person, will not like them.<br>
<br>
<br>Keep in mind that no matter what you do, someone will always tell you your work has gone downhill. My father, when watching The Simpsons, will always declare that they're "losing their edge." I point out that episode he just saw was made a year ago, in fact before the episode he saw on Sunday, but he still says it the next night. It's human nature. There's nothing you can do about it. Your job is to cartoon and to cartoon well, and make your editor laugh. <br>
<br>
Strips and Editorial Cartoons<br>
<br>The standard comic strip is either an ongoing series about the same or similar people/topics or a one-shot funny strip. An editorial cartoon is usually one frame and makes some sort of political, social or otherwise interesting statement.
