What is Sports?<br>
<br>If you don't know what Sports is by now, you need some help. However, the Sports Department covers games, interesting student athletes and coaches. Sports is an amalgam of news, features and opinions. Sports follows the essential structure of a features article while presenting news and allows for some writer commentary.<br>
<br>
Game Reports<br><br>
Leads<br>
<br>In general,most good leads describe one specific play, either the most important play of the game or a play indicative of how the game was played.The article should start from this specific point and become more and more broad. Other good leads describe an event unique to the team's situation.<br>
<br>Vivid images are key to "hooking" the reader (that is, to making them want to read the rest of the article).<br>
<br>
Organization<br>
<br> As stated earlier, the article should become more and more broad as it goes along. As in all other newspaper articles, images are key; it's easy to slip into "summary" format when you're reporting on the five or six games a team has played since your last article. However, summary articles should be avoided, as they imply that the writer wasn't at the game and heard the results from someone else.<br>
<br>
Interviewing<br>
<br>The coach and at least one of the team captains should be quoted in every article; other players should be quoted as needed. Dealing with uncooperative coaches;some team coaches feel only the student athletes  should be quoted and do not want any of their own quotes to appear in print. Since coaches are a valuable source of information, trying to badger a coach into going on the record is probably unwise. Only seek a quote from a combative coach if you are presented with a serious matter (e.g. player ineligibility) and not for game reports.<br>
<br>
Statistics<br>
<br>Sports writers are responsible for making sure that accurate game results and statistics appear in the paper. No sports article (game report, athlete spotlight, sports/feature) is complete without statistical references.<br>
<br>The statistics section of the sports page: stats should be easy to understand. Columns and rows should be headed properly. Game dates and player names should be included.<br>
<br>
Beat reporting<br><br>
General information for beat writers<br>
<br>1.A beat report is the sports section's  news article.
<br>2. A beat writer should understand the sport he or she is covering and have a full knowledge of all the terms specific to that sport.
<br>3. A beat writer should have the names and phone numbers of the team captains, as well as a full season schedule, at the start of the season. The latter is necessary not only for the writer making sure he/she is at as many games as possible, but also so that the sports editor can alert the photo editor as to when and where games will be.
<br>4. By the end of the season, the best beat reporters understand the team as well as team members do, and this shows in their writing.<br>
<br>
Athlete spotlights<br>
<br>An Athlete Spotlight is the sports section's equivalent of a features article. Athlete spotlights should include the athlete's background in the sport. The sports section should make a concerted effort to feature outstanding senior athletes in the Athlete Spotlight column. Features on underclassmen athletes can also run as sports/feature articles.
