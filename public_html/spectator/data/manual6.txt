Editorials and Opinions<br>
<br>An editorial is a piece expressing the views of The Spectator as a body and is unsigned. An opinion piece expresses the views of the writer alone. Besides an entertainment review and certain sports articles, editorials and opinion pieces are the only stories in the newspaper that reflect the opinion of the writer or the group that the writer represents. The following are components that make up a good editorial:<br>
<br>
A New or Interesting Topic<br>
<br>A controversial topic is a must for a good editorial. Boring topics or topics which everyone agrees upon usually don't interest readers. <br>
<br>
Support
<br>You must support your opinion on the topic. Statistics are always a good thing to arm your editorial with. So are quotes and examples that illustrate your point.<br> <br>
Solution<br>
<br>A writer must  include a solution in his or her editorial, no matter how simple it may be. <br>
<br>
Qualities of a Good Topic<br><br>
Focus<br>
Stay focused in your editorial. You should be able to state the claim of your editorial in one sentence. If you're going to discuss the ineffectiveness of a new AP policy in the school, focus only on that. It's possible to touch on topics that relate to your main topic, as long as they support your claim. <br>
<br>
Timeliness and Relevancy <br>
Try to write about recent issues that are relevant to the students of the school. An editorial will only catch the reader's eye if he or she can relate to the topic. If you write an editorial on U.S. strategies during World War II and don't relate it to the students of the school, not many readers would care enough to even read it, no matter how well it's written. <br>
<br>
Controversy<br>
What good is an editorial if you're not really arguing something? The most important part of an editorial topic is how controversial it is. You must choose a topic that has two sides to argue. Your editorial must try to convince the people on the other side to believe what you believe. Readers may argue with you in school. They may write Letters To the Editor. All that means is that you have chosen a good, controversial editorial topic and readers feel passionately about it enough to actually argue back. <br>
<br>
<br>
Support<br><br>
<br>
Opinion vs. True Opinion<br>
<br>You must support any claim you make in your editorial. This is the difference from an opinion and a true opinion. If you don't provide any reason why you feel the way that you do, you are simply whining and anybody can do that. The support is the substance of your editorial. It only takes a few sentences to state your claim. But the more support you arm your claim with, the more convincing your editorial will be. <br>
<br>
Statistics<br>
<br>Statistics are the strongest kind of support you can get. Numbers don't lie and nobody can argue with your statistics if you get them right. Use as many resources as you can think of to get your statistics. You should search the New York Times and other national newspapers. You should also ask anybody who might have information on the topic that you are writing about. They may be able to provide you with information to support your claim. Be sure to attribute your statistics. It makes your information more valid when readers know your numbers came from a source and were not just made up.<br>
<br>
Quotes <br>
<br>Quotes are also important in an editorial. High quotes are quotes from public figures, administrators, and anybody else who has had a direct role in the topic you are writing about. Many times, high quotes that support an editorial make the editorial a lot stronger. Readers will be more convinced if they see that someone educated on the topic also feels the way you do. Low quotes are quotes from regular students or anybody who is on the outside looking in at the topic you are writing about. Many times, low quotes can also support your editorial. They can provide the reader with another angle to look at your claim. <br>
<br>
Examples
<br>In addition to the other ways you have supported your editorial, try to find examples that illustrate your point. If you plan to write about the lack of money given to the English department, you can write about a certain English class that doesn't have enough money to buy books. Examples can sometimes be the clearest way to support your claim. You can play upon imagery and good description to get the idea across to your readers. <br>
<br>
Addressing the Opposition<br>
<br>Finally, you should at least touch upon the opposition's argument. There has to be somebody out there who does not feel the way you do and as they are reading your editorial, they are arguing back in their own minds. If you can somehow determine what these arguments are beforehand (and many times, it's easy to predict what the opposition would say), and then confront them, it will make your editorial that much stronger. Instead of waiting for them write back to the paper and then writing another editorial in defense of your first one, it is much easier to keep the opposition down before it has even started.<br>
<br>
<br>
Style<br>
Use of First Person Narrative<br>
<br>It's usually a bad idea to write an editorial in the first person. Unless the topic you are writing about is deeply personal, writing in the third person usually makes the editorial stronger. <br>
<br>
Rhetorical Questions<br>
<br>Rhetorical questions are effective once or twice in an editorial, but that should be the limit. Unless going for a certain effect, keep away from too many rhetorical questions. Why? Wouldn't it be annoying if an editorial kept on asking questions? Wouldn't it seem like the writer was not sure of himself? Wouldn't the editorial begin to seem accusatory? <br>
<br>
Wordiness<br>
<br>Be concise and to the point. Although writing style is very important, the readers are not interested in fancy prose or big words. They are interest in your opinion and wordiness just masks an opinion until readers can't even tell what it is.<br> <br>
Stay-Away Words<br>
<br>Stay away from words like, "I think," "maybe," "kind of," and other words that make the writer seem uncertain about his or her own claim. <br>
<br>
Columns vs. Editorials<br>
<br>There are always a few columns in the Op-Ed section. Writing a column is a little different from writing an editorial. In both, the writer must convey an opinion to the reader. However, many times, columns are written in a more personal nature. The writer addresses the reader and the use of the first person narrative is much more common. Column writers have a tough job. They must have their own distinctive style but still come up with new and interesting topics every issue.
