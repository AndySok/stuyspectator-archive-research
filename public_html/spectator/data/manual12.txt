News is actually divided into two parts: spot and general. <br>
<br>
<br>A.  Spot News. Spot news is any unplanned event where little advanced planning is possible. Photographers will often learn of spot news events through a call from their photography editor or through coincidental circumstances.  <br>
<br>B.  General News. General news assignments give photographers a chance to prepare. A photographer's main concerns with such assignments are typically arriving on time to get a good vantage point, making sure that names in a group picture are spelled correctly, and having enough energy and curiosity to produce an unusual, yet telling moment. A picture of a teacher or student will always be more visually interesting if an emotional facial expression or hand gesture is captured on film. A standing group of people all smiling at the camera  is a visually dull image. Take care to find angles or activities that will not only show the physical appearance of a group, but will reveal their personalities. <br>
<br>Be on your toes. Even during the most banal news conference, strange events happen. It is difficult but a photojournalist must always be prepared for the unusual and the newsworthy. <br>
<br>
Features Assignments<br>

<br>There are two types of feature assignments: human interest and pictorial. <br>
<br>
<br>A.  Human Interest. These features show persons being natural and unique. The images cannot be anticipated. They are one of a kind moments that capture a person or group being themselves: odd, humorous, and natural. Cute kids, animals, and nuns are traditional subject cliches.<br> <br>Features offer an opportunity for a page to be highlighted with a pleasant, happy picture that may offset the tragic events of the day. A photographer looking for human interest features thinks like a hunter. Keenly aware and observant, knowledgeable on matters of basic human nature, quiet and unassuming, and technically competent to capture quick and fleeting moments, the photographer stalks the city looking for pictures that go beyond the cliche. <br>
<br>B. Pictorials. The other type of feature picture is the much maligned pictorial. Pictorials rely on the graphic elements of composition and lighting more than subject matter. Because feature assignment photographers often are their own reporters, much of the responsibility for the caption is left to the photographer. Names and locations are a minimal requirement. Quotations from subjects bring more interest to an otherwise ordinary picture/caption package and increase the chances for a front page photo spread. <br>
<br>
Sports Assignments<br>

<br>Although most persons would link photojournalism with news assignments, the most common assignment is actually sports. Sports assignments combine the action and excitement of news within a clearly defined structure. The key for successful sports photography is to know that structure. You have to be familiar with the rules of the game to predict dramatic moments. You should also know the backgrounds of some of the key players and anticipate their contribution. If you know that a rookie kicker is about to attempt his first field goal for an NFL team you should concentrate your lens on his sideline preparations. In an instant, his face may reveal his nervousness that would make a good picture. <br>
<br>Sports Action and Sports Feature are categories within the sports assignment. <br>
<br>A.  Sports Action.  Sports Action is a photograph of any moment that occurs on the playing field during the run of the game. <br>
<br>B.  Sports Feature.  Sports Feature is a picture that shows anything else: an angry coach in the locker room, a frustrated player on the sideline, an anxious fan in the stands. As implied by the name, the same procedure applies to sports feature hunting as with human interest features. A photographer tries to capture a peak, dramatic event not happening on the playing field. 
<br>(Tip:  keep track of key plays by shooting the scoreboard immediately afterward.)<br> <br>
Portrait/Headshot Assignments<br>
<br>Readers want to know what people in the news look like. The portrait assignment is an opportunity for photographers to capture a person's personality. It is no easy task. Important and ordinary newsmakers tend to hide behind a facade of friendliness. Seldom does a photographer get the luxury to spend long periods of time with a busy businessman. All the photographer's instincts and technical competence come into play to watch for a moment when the subject's personality is revealed. <br>
<br>There are two kinds of portrait pictures: mug and environmental. <br>
<br>A.  Head (Mug) Shots. Those little head and shoulder, close-up portraits. The challenge for photographers is to make the mug shot more than a picture of a subject smiling for the camera. Despite its small size, the picture can and should be a telling record.  (For the purposes of the Spectator, the photograph should have a light background to highlight the subject; a dark background will only make the image harder to view.) <br>
<br>B.  The Environmental Portrait. The environmental portrait not only shows what the subject looks like, but also reveals aspects of the sitter's personality by the foreground and background objects the person displays. Personal mementos on a desk or hung on a wall let the reader know more about the subject than a simple portrait can reveal. It is a picture of a person AND that person's environment-NOT simply a picture of a person in an environment. <br>
<br>Even if a pen and pencil set on a desk or a large, leafy, potted palm is in the way, avoid the temptation to move those objects. Part of the challenge of being a photojournalist is to work with the limitations that are presented during a shooting session. Distracting visual elements are a part of the subject's personality and should be left in the composition. <br>

Picture Story/Photo Essays, Roving Reporter Assignments<br>
<br>Picture Story/Photo Essays, and Roving Reporter Assignments give a photographer a chance to slow down and produce a package of pictures over a longer period of time. At its best, a picture story illuminates a serious social problem through the telling in words and pictures of a particular person's plight. <br>
<br>A. Picture Story/Photo Essay.  A picture story usually has five kinds of pictures: an overall scene-setter, a medium distance interaction, a portrait, a close-up, and an ending picture. The overall scene-setter describes in one picture the essence of the story. The photograph should readily place the main subject in the context for the reader. The medium distance interaction picture should show the subject communicating with some other person connected with the story. A portrait is usually a candid moment that reveals the subject's personality. The close-up photograph can be a tightly cropped detail of an object or a person that tends to symbolize the person's situation. Finally, the ending picture sums up and concludes the set of pictures. A photographer tells a story with words and pictures. There should be a logical beginning, middle, and end. <br>
<br>B.  Roving Reporter Assignments.  These photographs are less structured because they do not necessarily need beginning, middle and end photographs.  The assignments usually have a theme or question that the subject answers and the photographs should reflect the response given.
