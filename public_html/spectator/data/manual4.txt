What is News?<br>
<br>News is the accurate and objective coverage of events. The staff reports on a variety of topics that impact the Stuyvesant community, both inside and outside of the school. Reporters look to a set of news values to help determine the newsworthiness of events. According to News Reporting and Writing by Melvin Mencher, these values are:<br>
- Timeliness.  <br>
- Impact, consequence, or importance <br>
- Prominence of the people involved<br>
- Proximity to readers<br>
- Conflict<br>
- The unusual nature of the event<br>
- Currency, the sudden interest people have in an ongoing situation. <br>
<br>Features covers interesting people, ongoing trends, or offbeat subjects that don't necessarily fall within the domain of news. Although features and news often overlap, there are certain types of articles that each department is responsible for. For example, news covers student government and any other organization's  meetings (SLT, Budget Committee), school visitors, speeches, etc.<br>
<br>
News stories must be:<br>
- Accurate: All information is verified before it is used.<br>
- Properly attributed: The reporter identifies his or her sources of information.<br>
- Balanced and fair: All sides in a controversy are given.<br>
- Objective: The news writer does not inject his or her feelings or opinions.<br>
- Brief and focused: The news story gets to the point quickly.<br>
- Well written: Stories are clear, direct, and interesting.<br>

News Story Structure<br>
The Inverted Pyramid<br>
<br>A news article should present a story starting with the general and ending with the specific. Develop the story's facts in descending order of importance, not chronologically! The reader should be able to leave at almost any point in the article.<br>
<br>The opening sentence;the lead;is a summary of the most important material. It tells the reader what to expect. The remainder of the story contains the information that supports and magnifies the lead and presents all the background material necessary to explain the story. This information answers the questions a reader might have after reading the lead.<br>
<br>According to News Reporting and Writing by Melvin Mencher, if a story continues from day to day, or follows one run a week or a month ago, assume that some readers, at least, did not see the earlier account. To make the story complete for them, include a sentence or two summarizing what went before. And do it quite high up in the story.<br>
<br>Write the lead, then support it in the next few paragraphs, weaving in details. Answer the 5 W's and the H in those paragraphs. Include relevant statistics, but don't overwhelm the reader with numbers. Determine an angle. What's the "spin" that's being put on the story? <br>
<br>As a reporter, you should ask yourself these questions when proofreading your article: <br>
- Does the lead work? Is it supported in the story? If it's an anecdote, does it really reflect the point of the story or is it just a nice anecdote?<br>
- What's the point of the story? Is the point clear? Is the point of the story early in the story, or does the reader have to wait?<br>
- Does the story make sense? Does it flow logically from one section to another, or does it play leap-frog? Is there just enough information ?<br>
<br>
The Lead<br>
<br>The art of news writing cannot be reduced to a series of inviolable rules, but journalists recognize that some approaches to lead sentences do not work. The lead is a clear, concise opening statement that relates the essence of the story. The reader should be able to get the general idea of the story from the lead. It can be one or two sentences or a paragraph but not much more. The lead usually answers two or more of the following questions: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? Almost always, who and what are answered in the lead. The lead depends on the journalist's own personal style. News articles usually open with a direct lead, which tells the reader the most important aspect of the story at once. <br>
<br>The reporter must list essential facts and inform the reader what the following body of the story is about. A good lead not only tells a reader what's in the story, it does it in a way as to emphasize the importance and significance of the subject. <br>
<br>A reporter should keep three words in mind when writing a good lead: active, vivid, and slant. 
Don't use passive verbs in leads and focus on the news and what is being said, changed, or voted on. Put the news in the lead. If someone delivers a speech, tell the reader what was said about the topic, not just that the topic was discussed. In meeting stories, lead with what action was taken on a topic, not that a topic was "discussed." The verb's job is to describe an action. Sentences generally work best when they are powered by strong verbs. Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb. A sentence is in the active voice when the subject does the acting;the man shot the deer. It's in the passive voice when the subject is the recipient of the action;the deer was shot by the man.<br>

How to use Quotes<br>
-  Always put good quotes up high in the article.<br>
-  In a direct quote, the attribution goes after the first natural pause. Attribution is "said Smith."<br>
-  Don't take quotes out of their context unless in doing so it will not at all change the person's thoughts and feelings. But try to avoid this. <br>
-  Use brackets to loyally preserve the meaning of grammatically or logically unclear quote. However, avoid the overuse of brackets. <br>
-  Always name names when quoting.<br>
-  A complete article is not a list of quotes! Make sure you're writing an article, not just listing quotes.
