Duplicate of the Charter of The Spectator<br>
Stuyvesant High School (Approved on May 18, 1998 by The Spectator Editorial Board)<br><br>

The goal of The Spectator is to inform the Stuyvesant community (including students, teachers, administrators, and parents) of the significant events and issues pertaining to the school. The Spectator is committed to journalistically ethical practices in its reporting and writing.<br><br>

The Spectator has been established as a forum for student expression and as a voice in the free and open discussion of issues. The Spectator provides a full opportunity for students to inquire, question and exchange ideas. Content should reflect all areas of student interest, including topics about which there may be dissent or controversy. Student journalists, in concert with a faculty adviser, will make the final content decisions for The Spectator.<br><br>

All student journalists must recognize that with editorial control comes responsibility, including the responsibility to follow professional journalism standards.
