</p><p>A ticket was simply not
</p><p>good enough to gain admission
</p><p>to the Murray Kahn Theater to
</p><p>watch SING! on April 14, 16, and
</p><p>17. For the first time, ticketholders
</p><p>had to have their hands
</p><p>stamped with blue, black, or red
</p><p>ink just inside the 345 Chambers
</p><p>Street entrance, and these
</p><p>stamps had to be checked at the
</p><p>main theater doors. Security
</p><p>guards were stationed at all theater
</p><p>entrances, inside the theater,
</p><p>and throughout the first
</p><p>floor.
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, bags, particularly
</p><p>those of cast and crew
</p><p>members, were checked for liquids.
</p><p>Last year, drinks were
</p><p>allowed into the building,
</p><p>though bottles were smelled for
</p><p>signs of alcohol. This year, however
</p><p>they were not permitted
</p><p>inside the building at all, following
</p><p>a very serious incident in
</p><p>which a member of the Soph-
</p><p>Frosh SING! band was rushed to
</p><p>the hospital for alcohol poisoning.
</p><p>She and another sophomore
</p><p>cast member were inebriated at
</p><p>their all-day SING! rehearsal on
</p><p>Monday, April 12.
</p><p>
</p><p>For reasons of safety and
</p><p>efficiency, it was requested that
</p><p>no one leave the building during
</p><p>SING! except in an emergency. If
</p><p>their departure was absolutely
</p><p>necessary, they could receive yet
</p><p>another stamp that would allow
</p><p>them to reenter the building.
</p><p>
</p><p>Once audience members
</p><p>passed the security .checkpoints.
</p><p>and were in their seats,
</p><p>they could enjoy SING!, during
</p><p>which they were taken to
</p><p>Heaven and Hell (Senior SING!),
</p><p>a disco (Junior SING!), and the
</p><p>office of television executives
</p><p>(Soph-Frosh SING!). In Senior
</p><p>SING!, a team from Heaven was
</p><p>sent to defrost Hell, which had
</p><p>recently acquired an air conditioner;
</p><p>in Junior SING!, another
</p><p>team, B-Unit, was created to
</p><p>save the world from an evil
</p><p>power-maniac named
</p><p>Malasangre; and in Soph-Frosh
</p><p>SING!, the hunt was on for a new
</p><p>show to fill the time slot of the
</p><p>network.s most popular show,
</p><p>Amigos, which went off the air
</p><p>due to the actors. discontent
</p><p>with the material.</p>
