What is Arts and Entertainment?<br>
<br>Arts and Entertainment is responsible for producing articles that critique productions from many categories of arts and entertainment, such as film, theater, music, television, art, literature, computer games, etc. The section is also responsible for covering and reviewing Stuyvesant endorsed productions in the theater community such as SING!, concerts, poetry readings, etc.<br>

On Writing an Arts and Entertainment Review<br>
The lead<br>
<br>Often reviewers don't realize that they are actually writing an article for a newspaper, which requires a lead. Instead of diving into the plot, the writer should consider a hook (an opening sentence that draws the reader in) that reflects their opinion of the work they are reviewing. <br>
<br>
Getting it Straight<br>
<br>It is important to spell the names of characters correctly; this should be easy to double check (Internet, playbill, etc.) For every actor you name, you should include their screen name and vice versa. Although you are writing a review, important relevant names (like those of the author, director, producer, etc.) should not be forgotten. Facts such as opening/release dates should be integrated into the articles as well. <br>
<br>
Evidence<br>
<br>As with any opinion piece, all statements about a performance, piece of art, etc. should be substantiated with evidence. It must be made clear why the acting was poor or why the plot was weak; it doesn't suffice to just state it. Was it because the actress forgot every other line? Or was the same plot used in three other movies this year (and name them)?<br>
<br>
Balance <br>
<br>Naturally there will be good things and bad things to say about what you're reviewing. Pointing them out and having balance in your article is necessary in a good review, but be careful not to contradict an opinion you make. If you write in the body of your article " the story-line was weak and cliched the actors were inaudible " don't write in your conclusion " all in all, the plot was decent and the acting was original." It is your duty to be honest with your opinion; if you thought something was horrible, don't be afraid to write it (with reason/evidence) and stand by it. <br>
<br>
Don't give away too much, especially the ending<br>
<br>This may seem like an obvious statement, but giving away too many details about a production can have the same effect. One of the duties of the writer is to reveal the right amount of information to perhaps make the reader want to see the movie or discover that that particular movie is the kind of lewd comedy they vehemently detest. A common mistake is for the writer to give a comprehensive summary, revealing too many details or untangling the twisted plot, that it essentially ruins it for the viewer. If you were critiquing the latest Michael Crichton thriller, your summary would probably be more revealing than the back cover or book jacket, but focus on reviewing (prose style, coherency, originality, etc.) rather than rehashing all the highlights of the novel. <br>
<br>
Reviewing Stuyvesant's Own Productions<br>
<br>It is the primary duty of a writer to be honest and unbiased when reviewing and writing an article. However, because the standards differ between students and professionals, writers should strive for balance and constructive criticism. It makes more sense to compare student productions with student productions, rather than off- Broadway plays.
