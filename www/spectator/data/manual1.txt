How to Use This Manual<br><br>Welcome to The Spectator, Stuyvesant High School's only student newspaper. In case you didn't know, The Spectator is a bi-weekly, completely self-funded and student produced newspaper. With more than ten staffs, twenty editors and nearly two hundred staff members, The Spectator is the largest student organization at Stuyvesant.<br><br>One of the major questions new staff members have to ask themselves is "What the hell are we supposed to do?" Well, as we've gone through the process of on-the-job training in journalism, we've picked up a few things. We've learned from experience, professional journalists, textbooks, handouts, and the wisdom of our editors. But it occurred to us that the whole thing shouldn't be such a mystery. So, we decided to write this Manual of Ethics and Procedures. This manual is brimming with useful tips, frequently encountered problems and straight-up "how-to" instruction.<br><br>For your convenience, it's broken up into our departments (i.e. news, op-ed, photo, business, etc.), so if you're on features and you don't care what layout is doing, don't bother reading that section. Read what's most pertinent to you, but we suggest you go over it all. The paper works as a team and we suggest you peruse those other sections at your leisure.<br><br>In addition, each section is broken up into various subsections, so if you're writing a story and you've gotten a good lead down, but don't know how to organize the rest of the story, you can flip your section until the bold type "ORGANIZATION" is staring you right in the face. So read it. This is good stuff.
