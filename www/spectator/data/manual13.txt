Ethical behavior is taught by helping a photographer understand the underlying philosophies that shape a decision, by the ideals contained in a code of ethics, and through a discussion of specific situations. <br>
<br>Here are some questions to consider:<br>
- Is it the public's right to know?<br>
- Is the photograph essential to understanding the article?  Or is it unnecessary?<br>
- What is the effect to the person involved?<br>
- Are you putting the person in a false light under the public eye?<br>
- What is the significance to the presentation of the event?<br>
- What was the manner in which the photograph was obtained?<br>
- What are the positive reasons vs. negative aspects of publishing the photograph?  <br>
- Does the subject pose a conflict of interest?<br>
- Is it a teacher?  Member of administration or other higher position?  How will it affect that person's life?<br>
<br>A mother crying over the death of her daughter is not simply an image to be focused, a print to be made, and a picture to be published. The mother's grief is a lesson in humanity. If the photojournalist produces a picture without a thought for her tragedy, the lesson is lost. But if the photographer cares for her loss, is made more humane, and causes the readers to share in her grief, photojournalism has reached its highest potential.<br>
<br>A modem photojournalist is a mixture of reporter, artist, and craftsperson. A photographer is expected to determine in 1/500th of a second, whether a subject is newsworthy, aesthetically pleasing, and technically possible to record on film.  Photojournalists should be well-educated, curious, and cool under stressful situations. Photographers must also be humane, caring individuals aware of the many ethical concerns that are a part of any news assignment.
