The Spectator is comprised of five basic writing staffs (news, features, opinions, sports and arts and entertainment), three graphics staffs (layout, photography and art), a copy staff and a business staff. Each one has its own definition, organization and practices. The sections below deal with the nuts and bolts of each staff.<br>
<br>
We'll start with the writing staffs. There are certain elements which all of the writing staffs have in common, like interviewing. We call these elements...<br>

The Basics<br>
Reporting<br>
Sources (high and low)<br>
<br><br>
A person with information necessary for a story or for background is called a source. A  reporter relies on two types of sources to report an event:<br>
- Physical sources, which consist of records, documents, reference works, newspaper clippings.<br>
- Human sources, which consist of authorities and people involved in events. They are often less reliable than physical sources because they may have interests to protect. They are untrained observers, and sometimes tell a reporter what they think the reporter wants to hear. When using human sources, reporters should find the person most qualified to speak;an authority on the subject, an eyewitness, an official, a participant.<br>
Always have high sources and low sources. High sources include authority figures, officials and parties with special knowledge of the subject. Low sources include "off-the-street" commentary.<br>
<br>
Attribution<br>
<br>The farther a reporter is from direct observation, the more concerned he/she should be about the accuracy of the information. Accurate and comprehensive direct observation is difficult enough. After the information has been filtered once or twice, only the most foolhardy journalist would stake his/her reputation on the accuracy of the report. To make clear to the reader that secondhand and thirdhand accounts are not based on a reporter's direct observation of the event, the information about the event must be attributed to a source. <br><br>
Attribution refers to two concepts:<br> 1.  Statements are attributed to the person making them. <br>
2.  Information about the events not witnessed by the reporter is usually attributed to the source of the information. <br>
<br>Attributing material to a source does not prove its truth. All a reporter does when attributing information is to place responsibility for it with the source named in the story. Attribution says only this: It is true that the source said such-and-such. Always attribute what you do not see or know to be factual unless it is common knowledge. When a reporter attributes assertions to a source, the reader can assess the accuracy and truth of the information on the basis of the general reliability of the source and his/her stake in the information. <br>
<br>Avoid commitments to leave out the  names of sources. All material must be attributed to a named source. The first mention of anyone in a news article is by his/her position and full name (first and last), whether a student or otherwise. Identify students by year. <br>

Interviewing<br>
Questions<br>
<br><br>How can reporters find the information they need if they don't ask questions? Questions are an essential part of the news writing process. When you put together a list of all the sources you need for your article, you should formulate questions that are specific and relevant to each source.<br>
<br>Don't be afraid to ask questions!  Reporters are sometimes nervous at the thought of having to conduct a "formal" interview, even though they would have no trouble carrying on an informal conversation. But consider: under which circumstance will the most candor and truth most likely emerge?<br>
<br>Remember your mission: to gather information. Don't be like this: "I had a wonderful conversation with my source	but when I sat down to write a story, I realized I had nothing new or interesting to write about. " Even if your interviewee babbles on at great length and excruciating detail, keep in mind what it is you set to find out.<br>
<br>Probe. Ask follow-up questions. Many inexperienced reporters think the proper approach calls for asking a set of questions and securing some kind of answer to each one. It's not question  one that yields the best answer. The answer to question one leads to question two and so on until you arrive at the heart of the topic. The subsequent questions that you've improvised on the spot probably won't be as nicely phrased as the planned questions, but what matters most is that you are listening and thinking throughout the interview and asking new questions based on those thoughts.<br>
<br>Abstract questions will get you abstract answers. 
<br>Abstract: "Do you think seven and a half periods of science is good for the school?"
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "So what did you think of the meeting?"<br>
<br>Be specific. Avoid "defining before seeing." Some reporters have a tendency to see a story first and then collect only that information that confirms their idea of what the story is about. A good reporter is a good listener. He/she takes the issue from various angles, gets underneath it and over it and around it. Then, he/she wants to know who else he/she should talk to about it.
Don't leave unanswered any questions the reader may have. Don't leave any holes in your story.<br> <br>Persistence. Don't give up easily! If you can't find what you're looking for the first time, try again. A journalist knows how important getting to the truth is. If a source refuses to talk to you, go back and try to talk to them a second time. If a source avoids giving you straight answers to your questions, ask them again. If a source won't confirm a piece of information that is important to the story, go to another source to verify it. If a source keeps putting off the interview (purposely or unknowingly), go back and confront them. Just because you weren't successful in getting the information that you wanted the first time, doesn't mean you can give up. Don't take no for an answer! Remember! Get off your asses, get on the phone and knock on doors!!<br>

Interviewing Tips<br>
<br>Quotes! Quotes!<br>
<br>Quotes are information, not decoration. If a reporter finishes an interview and later realizes that his/her source gave boring quotes, it's the reporter's fault, not the source's. It's the reporter's fault because the questions weren't good enough.<br>
<br>Don't rearrange quotes so that they no longer express their intent. Don't quote a person out of context. Since direct quotes are essential to a news article, don't  be afraid to ask the interviewee to speak a little more slowly, to repeat something, or to spell an unfamiliar word.<br>
Try to get quotes from a variety of sources. Different grades, genders, races, etc. <br>
<br>If two quotes say basically the same thing only one should appear in the article. If two quotes share the same position on a certain issue, but state different points for their position, they should be clustered together with conjunction sentences.<br>
<br>Try to get a tape recorder. To have proof of interview when interviewee denies quote. Keep all taped in<br>Direct quotes are the result of taking good notes. You don't have to write superfast or learn shorthand to take good notes. When a person is speaking, a reporter should write down the most important points. After the interview, the reporter can fill in the rest. Don't be afraid to ask your interviewee to slow down.<br>
<br>Get the interviewee's phone number in case you have to check a fact or get additional information. Don't hesitate to call people back to check or verify. Check the spelling of all proper names, not only when the correct spelling is unfamiliar to you, but when a name has two or more possible spellings.

Accuracy<br>
<br>A reporter must make every effort to check the accuracy of information through verification and documentation (despite time limits). Accuracy also applies to the use of language. The writer who uses imprecise rather than exact words risks being misunderstood or misleading readers.<br>
<br>Direct observation is the best way to obtain accurate information. Reporters have to be on the scene to let the reader see and hear the event. A story based on the reporter's firsthand observation is superior in accuracy and reader interest to one based on secondhand information. But when the reporter is not on the scene and information is obtained from those who were present, the reporter's story is a secondhand account which has been filtered through the source. In this case, a reporter must obtain information about the event from authoritative sources such as documents and records and from reliable individuals.<br>
<br>
Balance<br>
<br>A reporter must make every effort to get comment from anyone who has a stake in the story he/she is reporting;especially if the person is the target of an attack or allegations. If someone declines to comment, the reporter should make that clear in the article. If a reporter is unable to get comment from someone whose side of a story should be told, he/she should also make that clear. No story is fair if it omits facts of major importance or significance. Fairness includes completeness.<br>
<br>Reporters should ask themselves these questions when considering balance in a news story:<br>
Is the article fair? Are all sides accurately represented? Balanced reporting doesn't necessarily mean equal space. It does mean giving each side its best shot;that is, its strongest argument.
When a "spin" is intended, is it overly sympathetic or mean?<br>
<br>
Objectivity<br>
<br>When journalists talk about objectivity, they mean that the news story is free of the reporter's opinion or feelings, that it contains facts and that the account is from an impartial and independent observer. Stories are objective when they can be checked against some kind of record;text of a speech, minutes of a meeting, a police report, or vital statistics. Stories are objective when material in them is borne out by evidence. <br>
<br>Be sure your personal opinions or impressions do not find their way into your writing unless you are writing for the opinion, arts and entertainment or sports departments.
