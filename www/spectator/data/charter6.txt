not hold any positions in the Student Union.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Writers of any staff of

  Students may not write stories on their own teachers or activities they may be involved in.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. A student who writes an article about a teacher he or she may have in

      wishes to include his or her name.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp e. Should a student be subjected
       to disciplinary action by the administration of Stuyvesant High School, The Spectator staff 
       will decide on a case by case basis whether or not to include that student's name. The 
       determination will be based on the severity of the offense, prominence of the student, 
       severity of punishment and/or expectation of reader interest in the story.<br>&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp d. Names of alleged victims of crimes which do not carry a stigma (i.e. robbery)
        will be included and interviewed when possible.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp e. The names of 
        alleged victims of crimes such as rape and sexual assault will be withheld.<br><br>
