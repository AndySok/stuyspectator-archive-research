What is Features?<br>
<br>Features is news that focuses on people and the humanistic side of an issue, not just the facts. It involves issues that are made pertinent by a recent news occurrence. Features is objective. It deals with the impact of a news event on the community. <br>
<br>
Rules and Regulations<br>
<br>If you are writing about something that took place in the past, use the past tense. But when you write about what people think about the issue, use the present tense. Don't use rhetorical questions.<br>
<br>
The Delayed or Features Lead<br>
<br>The Delayed lead is an introduction to the story which does not necessarily contain all the information of a traditional lead (see News Department). Usually, the introduction to a delayed lead is an interesting anecdote or description of a scene. The actual lead which sums up the story is two or three paragraphs down. The introduction is as essential to an article as its body. The introduction captures the attention of the reader and should encourage the reader to continue reading the article. NOT ALL FEATURES ARTICLES ARE WRITTEN WITH DELAYED LEADS!<br>
<br>
<br>News hooks indicate the currency of the topic.
The Slant: Why is this article important now? What is different. What is special about it. <br>
<br>
Active Voice<br>
<br>The active voice ensures that the sentence is moving. When a sentence is written to illustrate one subject acting upon another it is more vivid, interesting and fluid. If the subject acts the voice is active, if the subject is acted upon the voice is passive. In passive voice sentences the auxiliary verb is usually present (was, will be, have been, is being) followed by a past participle (held, beaten, shown).  <br><br>
Passive voice: The manual was written by Michelle Wilson.<br>
Active voice: Michelle Wilson wrote the manual.<br>
Passive voice: The essay was plagiarized by the student.<br>
Active voice: The student plagiarized the essay.<br>
<br>Notice how the active voice is simpler, puts the emphasis on the person taking the action, and just sounds better.<br>
<br>
The Magic of Three<br>
<br>Three is hardly a crowd when it comes to writing. Three is perfect.
<br>Ex: It is a crime more chilling than any horror story. It is a crime which most people wish they could ignore. It is a crime has city residents living in terror.<br>
<br>This provides for emphasis and punctuation. Often it adds an element of drama to the story and spices up the writing.<br>
<br>
Direct sentences<br>
<br>Simpler is always better. Find a way to construct each sentence in using the fewest and simplest words while imparting as much information as possible. Use interesting images and words, but do not be flowery. Simple words can be just as effective as long, flowery ones. In fact, simple words are usually more effective.<br>
<br>Ex: The huge assassin plunged a knife in the gang member's stomach and fled down the dark alley, chugging like a freight train.
