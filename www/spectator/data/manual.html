<h3>Part 1</h3>

How to Use This Manual<br><br>Welcome to The Spectator, Stuyvesant High School's only student newspaper. In case you didn't know, The Spectator is a bi-weekly, completely self-funded and student produced newspaper. With more than ten staffs, twenty editors and nearly two hundred staff members, The Spectator is the largest student organization at Stuyvesant.<br><br>One of the major questions new staff members have to ask themselves is "What the hell are we supposed to do?" Well, as we've gone through the process of on-the-job training in journalism, we've picked up a few things. We've learned from experience, professional journalists, textbooks, handouts, and the wisdom of our editors. But it occurred to us that the whole thing shouldn't be such a mystery. So, we decided to write this Manual of Ethics and Procedures. This manual is brimming with useful tips, frequently encountered problems and straight-up "how-to" instruction.<br><br>For your convenience, it's broken up into our departments (i.e. news, op-ed, photo, business, etc.), so if you're on features and you don't care what layout is doing, don't bother reading that section. Read what's most pertinent to you, but we suggest you go over it all. The paper works as a team and we suggest you peruse those other sections at your leisure.<br><br>In addition, each section is broken up into various subsections, so if you're writing a story and you've gotten a good lead down, but don't know how to organize the rest of the story, you can flip your section until the bold type "ORGANIZATION" is staring you right in the face. So read it. This is good stuff.

<h3>Part 3</h3>

The Spectator is comprised of five basic writing staffs (news, features, opinions, sports and arts and entertainment), three graphics staffs (layout, photography and art), a copy staff and a business staff. Each one has its own definition, organization and practices. The sections below deal with the nuts and bolts of each staff.<br>
<br>
We'll start with the writing staffs. There are certain elements which all of the writing staffs have in common, like interviewing. We call these elements...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Basics<br>
Reporting<br>
Sources (high and low)<br>
<br><br>
A person with information necessary for a story or for background is called a source. A  reporter relies on two types of sources to report an event:<br>
- Physical sources, which consist of records, documents, reference works, newspaper clippings.<br>
- Human sources, which consist of authorities and people involved in events. They are often less reliable than physical sources because they may have interests to protect. They are untrained observers, and sometimes tell a reporter what they think the reporter wants to hear. When using human sources, reporters should find the person most qualified to speak;an authority on the subject, an eyewitness, an official, a participant.<br>
Always have high sources and low sources. High sources include authority figures, officials and parties with special knowledge of the subject. Low sources include "off-the-street" commentary.<br>
<br>
Attribution<br>
<br>The farther a reporter is from direct observation, the more concerned he/she should be about the accuracy of the information. Accurate and comprehensive direct observation is difficult enough. After the information has been filtered once or twice, only the most foolhardy journalist would stake his/her reputation on the accuracy of the report. To make clear to the reader that secondhand and thirdhand accounts are not based on a reporter's direct observation of the event, the information about the event must be attributed to a source. <br><br>
Attribution refers to two concepts:<br> 1.  Statements are attributed to the person making them. <br>
2.  Information about the events not witnessed by the reporter is usually attributed to the source of the information. <br>
<br>Attributing material to a source does not prove its truth. All a reporter does when attributing information is to place responsibility for it with the source named in the story. Attribution says only this: It is true that the source said such-and-such. Always attribute what you do not see or know to be factual unless it is common knowledge. When a reporter attributes assertions to a source, the reader can assess the accuracy and truth of the information on the basis of the general reliability of the source and his/her stake in the information. <br>
<br>Avoid commitments to leave out the  names of sources. All material must be attributed to a named source. The first mention of anyone in a news article is by his/her position and full name (first and last), whether a student or otherwise. Identify students by year. <br>
<br>ex: junior Alice Smith
<br><br>

Interviewing<br>
Questions<br>
<br><br>How can reporters find the information they need if they don't ask questions? Questions are an essential part of the news writing process. When you put together a list of all the sources you need for your article, you should formulate questions that are specific and relevant to each source.<br>
<br>Don't be afraid to ask questions!  Reporters are sometimes nervous at the thought of having to conduct a "formal" interview, even though they would have no trouble carrying on an informal conversation. But consider: under which circumstance will the most candor and truth most likely emerge?<br>
<br>Remember your mission: to gather information. Don't be like this: "I had a wonderful conversation with my source	but when I sat down to write a story, I realized I had nothing new or interesting to write about. " Even if your interviewee babbles on at great length and excruciating detail, keep in mind what it is you set to find out.<br>
<br>Probe. Ask follow-up questions. Many inexperienced reporters think the proper approach calls for asking a set of questions and securing some kind of answer to each one. It's not question  one that yields the best answer. The answer to question one leads to question two and so on until you arrive at the heart of the topic. The subsequent questions that you've improvised on the spot probably won't be as nicely phrased as the planned questions, but what matters most is that you are listening and thinking throughout the interview and asking new questions based on those thoughts.<br>
<br>Abstract questions will get you abstract answers. 
<br>Abstract: "Do you think seven and a half periods of science is good for the school?"
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "So what did you think of the meeting?"<br>
<br>Be specific. Avoid "defining before seeing." Some reporters have a tendency to see a story first and then collect only that information that confirms their idea of what the story is about. A good reporter is a good listener. He/she takes the issue from various angles, gets underneath it and over it and around it. Then, he/she wants to know who else he/she should talk to about it.
Don't leave unanswered any questions the reader may have. Don't leave any holes in your story.<br> <br>Persistence. Don't give up easily! If you can't find what you're looking for the first time, try again. A journalist knows how important getting to the truth is. If a source refuses to talk to you, go back and try to talk to them a second time. If a source avoids giving you straight answers to your questions, ask them again. If a source won't confirm a piece of information that is important to the story, go to another source to verify it. If a source keeps putting off the interview (purposely or unknowingly), go back and confront them. Just because you weren't successful in getting the information that you wanted the first time, doesn't mean you can give up. Don't take no for an answer! Remember! Get off your asses, get on the phone and knock on doors!!<br>
<br>
Interviewing Tips<br>
<br>Quotes! Quotes!<br>
<br>Quotes are information, not decoration. If a reporter finishes an interview and later realizes that his/her source gave boring quotes, it's the reporter's fault, not the source's. It's the reporter's fault because the questions weren't good enough.<br>
<br>Don't rearrange quotes so that they no longer express their intent. Don't quote a person out of context. Since direct quotes are essential to a news article, don't  be afraid to ask the interviewee to speak a little more slowly, to repeat something, or to spell an unfamiliar word.<br>
Try to get quotes from a variety of sources. Different grades, genders, races, etc. <br>
<br>If two quotes say basically the same thing only one should appear in the article. If two quotes share the same position on a certain issue, but state different points for their position, they should be clustered together with conjunction sentences.<br>
<br>Try to get a tape recorder. To have proof of interview when interviewee denies quote. Keep all taped in<br>Direct quotes are the result of taking good notes. You don't have to write superfast or learn shorthand to take good notes. When a person is speaking, a reporter should write down the most important points. After the interview, the reporter can fill in the rest. Don't be afraid to ask your interviewee to slow down.<br>
<br>Get the interviewee's phone number in case you have to check a fact or get additional information. Don't hesitate to call people back to check or verify. Check the spelling of all proper names, not only when the correct spelling is unfamiliar to you, but when a name has two or more possible spellings.
(Robin/Robyn, Steven/Stephen)<br>
<br>
Accuracy<br>
<br>A reporter must make every effort to check the accuracy of information through verification and documentation (despite time limits). Accuracy also applies to the use of language. The writer who uses imprecise rather than exact words risks being misunderstood or misleading readers.<br>
<br>Direct observation is the best way to obtain accurate information. Reporters have to be on the scene to let the reader see and hear the event. A story based on the reporter's firsthand observation is superior in accuracy and reader interest to one based on secondhand information. But when the reporter is not on the scene and information is obtained from those who were present, the reporter's story is a secondhand account which has been filtered through the source. In this case, a reporter must obtain information about the event from authoritative sources such as documents and records and from reliable individuals.<br>
<br>
Balance<br>
<br>A reporter must make every effort to get comment from anyone who has a stake in the story he/she is reporting;especially if the person is the target of an attack or allegations. If someone declines to comment, the reporter should make that clear in the article. If a reporter is unable to get comment from someone whose side of a story should be told, he/she should also make that clear. No story is fair if it omits facts of major importance or significance. Fairness includes completeness.<br>
<br>Reporters should ask themselves these questions when considering balance in a news story:<br>
Is the article fair? Are all sides accurately represented? Balanced reporting doesn't necessarily mean equal space. It does mean giving each side its best shot;that is, its strongest argument.
When a "spin" is intended, is it overly sympathetic or mean?<br>
<br>
Objectivity<br>
<br>When journalists talk about objectivity, they mean that the news story is free of the reporter's opinion or feelings, that it contains facts and that the account is from an impartial and independent observer. Stories are objective when they can be checked against some kind of record;text of a speech, minutes of a meeting, a police report, or vital statistics. Stories are objective when material in them is borne out by evidence. <br>
<br>Be sure your personal opinions or impressions do not find their way into your writing unless you are writing for the opinion, arts and entertainment or sports departments.

<h3>Part 4</h3>

What is News?<br>
<br>News is the accurate and objective coverage of events. The staff reports on a variety of topics that impact the Stuyvesant community, both inside and outside of the school. Reporters look to a set of news values to help determine the newsworthiness of events. According to News Reporting and Writing by Melvin Mencher, these values are:<br>
- Timeliness.  <br>
- Impact, consequence, or importance <br>
- Prominence of the people involved<br>
- Proximity to readers<br>
- Conflict<br>
- The unusual nature of the event<br>
- Currency, the sudden interest people have in an ongoing situation. <br>
<br>Features covers interesting people, ongoing trends, or offbeat subjects that don't necessarily fall within the domain of news. Although features and news often overlap, there are certain types of articles that each department is responsible for. For example, news covers student government and any other organization's  meetings (SLT, Budget Committee), school visitors, speeches, etc.<br>
<br>
News stories must be:<br>
- Accurate: All information is verified before it is used.<br>
- Properly attributed: The reporter identifies his or her sources of information.<br>
- Balanced and fair: All sides in a controversy are given.<br>
- Objective: The news writer does not inject his or her feelings or opinions.<br>
- Brief and focused: The news story gets to the point quickly.<br>
- Well written: Stories are clear, direct, and interesting.<br>
<br>
News Story Structure<br>
The Inverted Pyramid<br>
<br>A news article should present a story starting with the general and ending with the specific. Develop the story's facts in descending order of importance, not chronologically! The reader should be able to leave at almost any point in the article.<br>
<br>The opening sentence;the lead;is a summary of the most important material. It tells the reader what to expect. The remainder of the story contains the information that supports and magnifies the lead and presents all the background material necessary to explain the story. This information answers the questions a reader might have after reading the lead.<br>
<br>According to News Reporting and Writing by Melvin Mencher, if a story continues from day to day, or follows one run a week or a month ago, assume that some readers, at least, did not see the earlier account. To make the story complete for them, include a sentence or two summarizing what went before. And do it quite high up in the story.<br>
<br>Write the lead, then support it in the next few paragraphs, weaving in details. Answer the 5 W's and the H in those paragraphs. Include relevant statistics, but don't overwhelm the reader with numbers. Determine an angle. What's the "spin" that's being put on the story? <br>
<br>As a reporter, you should ask yourself these questions when proofreading your article: <br>
- Does the lead work? Is it supported in the story? If it's an anecdote, does it really reflect the point of the story or is it just a nice anecdote?<br>
- What's the point of the story? Is the point clear? Is the point of the story early in the story, or does the reader have to wait?<br>
- Does the story make sense? Does it flow logically from one section to another, or does it play leap-frog? Is there just enough information ?<br>
<br>
The Lead<br>
<br>The art of news writing cannot be reduced to a series of inviolable rules, but journalists recognize that some approaches to lead sentences do not work. The lead is a clear, concise opening statement that relates the essence of the story. The reader should be able to get the general idea of the story from the lead. It can be one or two sentences or a paragraph but not much more. The lead usually answers two or more of the following questions: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? Almost always, who and what are answered in the lead. The lead depends on the journalist's own personal style. News articles usually open with a direct lead, which tells the reader the most important aspect of the story at once. <br>
<br>The reporter must list essential facts and inform the reader what the following body of the story is about. A good lead not only tells a reader what's in the story, it does it in a way as to emphasize the importance and significance of the subject. <br>
<br>A reporter should keep three words in mind when writing a good lead: active, vivid, and slant. 
Don't use passive verbs in leads and focus on the news and what is being said, changed, or voted on. Put the news in the lead. If someone delivers a speech, tell the reader what was said about the topic, not just that the topic was discussed. In meeting stories, lead with what action was taken on a topic, not that a topic was "discussed." The verb's job is to describe an action. Sentences generally work best when they are powered by strong verbs. Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb. A sentence is in the active voice when the subject does the acting;the man shot the deer. It's in the passive voice when the subject is the recipient of the action;the deer was shot by the man.<br>
<br>
How to use Quotes<br>
-  Always put good quotes up high in the article.<br>
-  In a direct quote, the attribution goes after the first natural pause. Attribution is "said Smith."<br>
-  Don't take quotes out of their context unless in doing so it will not at all change the person's thoughts and feelings. But try to avoid this. <br>
-  Use brackets to loyally preserve the meaning of grammatically or logically unclear quote. However, avoid the overuse of brackets. <br>
-  Always name names when quoting.<br>
-  A complete article is not a list of quotes! Make sure you're writing an article, not just listing quotes.

<h3>Part 5</h3>

What is Features?<br>
<br>Features is news that focuses on people and the humanistic side of an issue, not just the facts. It involves issues that are made pertinent by a recent news occurrence. Features is objective. It deals with the impact of a news event on the community. <br>
<br>
Rules and Regulations<br>
<br>If you are writing about something that took place in the past, use the past tense. But when you write about what people think about the issue, use the present tense. Don't use rhetorical questions.<br>
<br>
The Delayed or Features Lead<br>
<br>The Delayed lead is an introduction to the story which does not necessarily contain all the information of a traditional lead (see News Department). Usually, the introduction to a delayed lead is an interesting anecdote or description of a scene. The actual lead which sums up the story is two or three paragraphs down. The introduction is as essential to an article as its body. The introduction captures the attention of the reader and should encourage the reader to continue reading the article. NOT ALL FEATURES ARTICLES ARE WRITTEN WITH DELAYED LEADS!<br>
<br>
<br>News hooks indicate the currency of the topic.
The Slant: Why is this article important now? What is different. What is special about it. <br>
<br>
Active Voice<br>
<br>The active voice ensures that the sentence is moving. When a sentence is written to illustrate one subject acting upon another it is more vivid, interesting and fluid. If the subject acts the voice is active, if the subject is acted upon the voice is passive. In passive voice sentences the auxiliary verb is usually present (was, will be, have been, is being) followed by a past participle (held, beaten, shown).  <br><br>
Passive voice: The manual was written by Michelle Wilson.<br>
Active voice: Michelle Wilson wrote the manual.<br>
Passive voice: The essay was plagiarized by the student.<br>
Active voice: The student plagiarized the essay.<br>
<br>Notice how the active voice is simpler, puts the emphasis on the person taking the action, and just sounds better.<br>
<br>
The Magic of Three<br>
<br>Three is hardly a crowd when it comes to writing. Three is perfect.
<br>Ex: It is a crime more chilling than any horror story. It is a crime which most people wish they could ignore. It is a crime has city residents living in terror.<br>
<br>This provides for emphasis and punctuation. Often it adds an element of drama to the story and spices up the writing.<br>
<br>
Direct sentences<br>
<br>Simpler is always better. Find a way to construct each sentence in using the fewest and simplest words while imparting as much information as possible. Use interesting images and words, but do not be flowery. Simple words can be just as effective as long, flowery ones. In fact, simple words are usually more effective.<br>
<br>Ex: The huge assassin plunged a knife in the gang member's stomach and fled down the dark alley, chugging like a freight train.

<h3>Part 6</h3>

Editorials and Opinions<br>
<br>An editorial is a piece expressing the views of The Spectator as a body and is unsigned. An opinion piece expresses the views of the writer alone. Besides an entertainment review and certain sports articles, editorials and opinion pieces are the only stories in the newspaper that reflect the opinion of the writer or the group that the writer represents. The following are components that make up a good editorial:<br>
<br>
A New or Interesting Topic<br>
<br>A controversial topic is a must for a good editorial. Boring topics or topics which everyone agrees upon usually don't interest readers. <br>
<br>
Support
<br>You must support your opinion on the topic. Statistics are always a good thing to arm your editorial with. So are quotes and examples that illustrate your point.<br> <br>
Solution<br>
<br>A writer must  include a solution in his or her editorial, no matter how simple it may be. <br>
<br>
Qualities of a Good Topic<br><br>
Focus<br>
Stay focused in your editorial. You should be able to state the claim of your editorial in one sentence. If you're going to discuss the ineffectiveness of a new AP policy in the school, focus only on that. It's possible to touch on topics that relate to your main topic, as long as they support your claim. <br>
<br>
Timeliness and Relevancy <br>
Try to write about recent issues that are relevant to the students of the school. An editorial will only catch the reader's eye if he or she can relate to the topic. If you write an editorial on U.S. strategies during World War II and don't relate it to the students of the school, not many readers would care enough to even read it, no matter how well it's written. <br>
<br>
Controversy<br>
What good is an editorial if you're not really arguing something? The most important part of an editorial topic is how controversial it is. You must choose a topic that has two sides to argue. Your editorial must try to convince the people on the other side to believe what you believe. Readers may argue with you in school. They may write Letters To the Editor. All that means is that you have chosen a good, controversial editorial topic and readers feel passionately about it enough to actually argue back. <br>
<br>
<br>
Support<br><br>
<br>
Opinion vs. True Opinion<br>
<br>You must support any claim you make in your editorial. This is the difference from an opinion and a true opinion. If you don't provide any reason why you feel the way that you do, you are simply whining and anybody can do that. The support is the substance of your editorial. It only takes a few sentences to state your claim. But the more support you arm your claim with, the more convincing your editorial will be. <br>
<br>
Statistics<br>
<br>Statistics are the strongest kind of support you can get. Numbers don't lie and nobody can argue with your statistics if you get them right. Use as many resources as you can think of to get your statistics. You should search the New York Times and other national newspapers. You should also ask anybody who might have information on the topic that you are writing about. They may be able to provide you with information to support your claim. Be sure to attribute your statistics. It makes your information more valid when readers know your numbers came from a source and were not just made up.<br>
<br>
Quotes <br>
<br>Quotes are also important in an editorial. High quotes are quotes from public figures, administrators, and anybody else who has had a direct role in the topic you are writing about. Many times, high quotes that support an editorial make the editorial a lot stronger. Readers will be more convinced if they see that someone educated on the topic also feels the way you do. Low quotes are quotes from regular students or anybody who is on the outside looking in at the topic you are writing about. Many times, low quotes can also support your editorial. They can provide the reader with another angle to look at your claim. <br>
<br>
Examples
<br>In addition to the other ways you have supported your editorial, try to find examples that illustrate your point. If you plan to write about the lack of money given to the English department, you can write about a certain English class that doesn't have enough money to buy books. Examples can sometimes be the clearest way to support your claim. You can play upon imagery and good description to get the idea across to your readers. <br>
<br>
Addressing the Opposition<br>
<br>Finally, you should at least touch upon the opposition's argument. There has to be somebody out there who does not feel the way you do and as they are reading your editorial, they are arguing back in their own minds. If you can somehow determine what these arguments are beforehand (and many times, it's easy to predict what the opposition would say), and then confront them, it will make your editorial that much stronger. Instead of waiting for them write back to the paper and then writing another editorial in defense of your first one, it is much easier to keep the opposition down before it has even started.<br>
<br>
<br>
Style<br>
Use of First Person Narrative<br>
<br>It's usually a bad idea to write an editorial in the first person. Unless the topic you are writing about is deeply personal, writing in the third person usually makes the editorial stronger. <br>
<br>
Rhetorical Questions<br>
<br>Rhetorical questions are effective once or twice in an editorial, but that should be the limit. Unless going for a certain effect, keep away from too many rhetorical questions. Why? Wouldn't it be annoying if an editorial kept on asking questions? Wouldn't it seem like the writer was not sure of himself? Wouldn't the editorial begin to seem accusatory? <br>
<br>
Wordiness<br>
<br>Be concise and to the point. Although writing style is very important, the readers are not interested in fancy prose or big words. They are interest in your opinion and wordiness just masks an opinion until readers can't even tell what it is.<br> <br>
Stay-Away Words<br>
<br>Stay away from words like, "I think," "maybe," "kind of," and other words that make the writer seem uncertain about his or her own claim. <br>
<br>
Columns vs. Editorials<br>
<br>There are always a few columns in the Op-Ed section. Writing a column is a little different from writing an editorial. In both, the writer must convey an opinion to the reader. However, many times, columns are written in a more personal nature. The writer addresses the reader and the use of the first person narrative is much more common. Column writers have a tough job. They must have their own distinctive style but still come up with new and interesting topics every issue.

<br>Arts and Entertainment is responsible for producing articles that critique productions from many categories of arts and entertainment, such as film, theater, music, television, art, literature, computer games, etc. The section is also responsible for covering and reviewing Stuyvesant endorsed productions in the theater community such as SING!, concerts, poetry readings, etc.<br>
<br>
On Writing an Arts and Entertainment Review<br>
The lead<br>
<br>Often reviewers don't realize that they are actually writing an article for a newspaper, which requires a lead. Instead of diving into the plot, the writer should consider a hook (an opening sentence that draws the reader in) that reflects their opinion of the work they are reviewing. <br>
<br>
Getting it Straight<br>
<br>It is important to spell the names of characters correctly; this should be easy to double check (Internet, playbill, etc.) For every actor you name, you should include their screen name and vice versa. Although you are writing a review, important relevant names (like those of the author, director, producer, etc.) should not be forgotten. Facts such as opening/release dates should be integrated into the articles as well. <br>
<br>
Evidence<br>
<br>As with any opinion piece, all statements about a performance, piece of art, etc. should be substantiated with evidence. It must be made clear why the acting was poor or why the plot was weak; it doesn't suffice to just state it. Was it because the actress forgot every other line? Or was the same plot used in three other movies this year (and name them)?<br>
<br>
Balance <br>
<br>Naturally there will be good things and bad things to say about what you're reviewing. Pointing them out and having balance in your article is necessary in a good review, but be careful not to contradict an opinion you make. If you write in the body of your article " the story-line was weak and cliched the actors were inaudible " don't write in your conclusion " all in all, the plot was decent and the acting was original." It is your duty to be honest with your opinion; if you thought something was horrible, don't be afraid to write it (with reason/evidence) and stand by it. <br>
<br>
Don't give away too much, especially the ending<br>
<br>This may seem like an obvious statement, but giving away too many details about a production can have the same effect. One of the duties of the writer is to reveal the right amount of information to perhaps make the reader want to see the movie or discover that that particular movie is the kind of lewd comedy they vehemently detest. A common mistake is for the writer to give a comprehensive summary, revealing too many details or untangling the twisted plot, that it essentially ruins it for the viewer. If you were critiquing the latest Michael Crichton thriller, your summary would probably be more revealing than the back cover or book jacket, but focus on reviewing (prose style, coherency, originality, etc.) rather than rehashing all the highlights of the novel. <br>
<br>
Reviewing Stuyvesant's Own Productions<br>
<br>It is the primary duty of a writer to be honest and unbiased when reviewing and writing an article. However, because the standards differ between students and professionals, writers should strive for balance and constructive criticism. It makes more sense to compare student productions with student productions, rather than off- Broadway plays. 

<h3>Part 8</h3>

What is Sports?<br>
<br>If you don't know what Sports is by now, you need some help. However, the Sports Department covers games, interesting student athletes and coaches. Sports is an amalgam of news, features and opinions. Sports follows the essential structure of a features article while presenting news and allows for some writer commentary.<br>
<br>
Game Reports<br><br>
Leads<br>
<br>In general,most good leads describe one specific play, either the most important play of the game or a play indicative of how the game was played.The article should start from this specific point and become more and more broad. Other good leads describe an event unique to the team's situation.<br>
<br>Vivid images are key to "hooking" the reader (that is, to making them want to read the rest of the article).<br>
<br>
Organization<br>
<br> As stated earlier, the article should become more and more broad as it goes along. As in all other newspaper articles, images are key; it's easy to slip into "summary" format when you're reporting on the five or six games a team has played since your last article. However, summary articles should be avoided, as they imply that the writer wasn't at the game and heard the results from someone else.<br>
<br>
Interviewing<br>
<br>The coach and at least one of the team captains should be quoted in every article; other players should be quoted as needed. Dealing with uncooperative coaches;some team coaches feel only the student athletes  should be quoted and do not want any of their own quotes to appear in print. Since coaches are a valuable source of information, trying to badger a coach into going on the record is probably unwise. Only seek a quote from a combative coach if you are presented with a serious matter (e.g. player ineligibility) and not for game reports.<br>
<br>
Statistics<br>
<br>Sports writers are responsible for making sure that accurate game results and statistics appear in the paper. No sports article (game report, athlete spotlight, sports/feature) is complete without statistical references.<br>
<br>The statistics section of the sports page: stats should be easy to understand. Columns and rows should be headed properly. Game dates and player names should be included.<br>
<br>
Beat reporting<br><br>
General information for beat writers<br>
<br>1.A beat report is the sports section's  news article.
<br>2. A beat writer should understand the sport he or she is covering and have a full knowledge of all the terms specific to that sport.
<br>3. A beat writer should have the names and phone numbers of the team captains, as well as a full season schedule, at the start of the season. The latter is necessary not only for the writer making sure he/she is at as many games as possible, but also so that the sports editor can alert the photo editor as to when and where games will be.
<br>4. By the end of the season, the best beat reporters understand the team as well as team members do, and this shows in their writing.<br>
<br>
Athlete spotlights<br>
<br>An Athlete Spotlight is the sports section's equivalent of a features article. Athlete spotlights should include the athlete's background in the sport. The sports section should make a concerted effort to feature outstanding senior athletes in the Athlete Spotlight column. Features on underclassmen athletes can also run as sports/feature articles.

<h3>Part 9</h3>

What is Art?<br>
<br>If you've ever had an idea for a cartoon, you can probably have many more. You'll find that after a certain point it becomes systematic, no longer a question of being able to think of one but of choosing the best one you've thought of. When done well, cartoons can be as strong and deep and true as a book. In addition, they're much shorter, have more pictures, and tend to be funnier. So kick ass. No one currently on the art staff has had any formal training. Here's a list of everything we've learned by experience:<br>
<br>
Meetings<br>
<br>Come to meetings. Their most important function is to remind you that the newspaper exists. They're a place to trade ideas  more often than not, I leave meetings knowing what I'm going to draw. Also, meetings are where group projects get started, and you don't want to be left out. <br>
<br>
Ideas and Cartoons<br><br>
Use your life as material.<br>
<br>There's no rule saying that The spectator cartoons have to take place in school, but they should tangentially relate to high school existence. i.e: don't write about 30-year-old millionaires on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange<br>
<br>
Be unusual.<br>
<br>A billion cartoons have been drawn about the fact that school food is bad and that students don't sleep. Trust me, I've read like, ALL of them. Beware the Cartoon That Compares Restrictive School Policies to Those Of A Fascist Police State. These have been done. So what are you supposed to do, stop writing about sleep depravation, questionable breakfast and your chemistry crush who always glances up when you've unbalanced an equation? Of course not. What else would you write about? But you have to tackle everything in a new way, because that's what cartoons are for.<br>
<br>
Don't use too many words...<br>
<br>I'm not saying you should use spare, minimalist prose  some strips are very verbal and that's great. Just make sure you don't have boring explanations that could be better indicated visually: If you have a car driving up to a menu with a walkie-talkie in it, no one has to say, "McDonald's Drive Thru, can I take your order?"<br>
<br>
...or too many frames. <br>
Remember the more frames you have, the less space you have for each one. By all means, use them if you need them, but make sure you do.<br>
<br>
Team up<br>
<br>This is so important I don't know why I let it wait until number five. If you have ideas but can't draw, find someone who can. If you're an artist with no ideas, offer your services. Some people are possessive and would rather do it all themselves, but team work is wonderful; it's the reason we have a staff. Anyway, it's about making good cartoons, not your stupid feelings.<br>
<br>
Find some way to draw hands. <br>
<br>They don't need to resemble actual hands to any degree. As long as they're expressive and your characters aren't afraid to use them.<br>
<br>
When in doubt, ask everyone. <br>
<br>If you're juggling two lines and wondering which is funnier, if you don't know if a drawing is clear or whether something is offensive, ask someone. Remember, your goal is to make a cartoon that people will like. If you disagree with this goal, that's fine, your cartoons will die by natural selection because the art editor, a person, will not like them.<br>
<br>
<br>Keep in mind that no matter what you do, someone will always tell you your work has gone downhill. My father, when watching The Simpsons, will always declare that they're "losing their edge." I point out that episode he just saw was made a year ago, in fact before the episode he saw on Sunday, but he still says it the next night. It's human nature. There's nothing you can do about it. Your job is to cartoon and to cartoon well, and make your editor laugh. <br>
<br>
Strips and Editorial Cartoons<br>
<br>The standard comic strip is either an ongoing series about the same or similar people/topics or a one-shot funny strip. An editorial cartoon is usually one frame and makes some sort of political, social or otherwise interesting statement.

<h3>Part 10</h3>

Front Page<br>
<br>The front page of the newspaper is the most important page there is. Therefore, it's layout's job to make it the best looking page there is as well. There should be, at minimum, four front page articles. If the editor-in-chief doesn't want four articles on the front page, fight him. There is only so much layout you can do with three articles before it becomes repetitive and ugly. Each article should continue on the front page and have jumps inside, leading the reader further into the paper. Ideally, this should be the only time in the newspaper that you jump articles other than on the back sports page. People hate having to turn the page to finish an article, so we shouldn't make them. Of course, it is not always possible to follow this rule without making the paper look unattractive. In those cases, you can jump articles. But do this only rarely.<br>
<br>The lead article should go on the top right hand side of the paper, two, three or four columns wide. This article's headline font is Franklin Gothic. No other article in the paper should have this headline font. Franklin Gothic Condensed or Italic yes, but not straight Franklin Gothic. The lead feature article almost always goes all the way down the left hand column of the page in a gray (7% shading) box with a text inset of three. Try to get a picture or a drawing for this article. It looks good in the corner, and might be the only picture you get for a features article each issue. The front cover should have at least three photos, one of which has to be for the lead article. If that article doesn't have the picture, it can't be the lead. Period.<br>
<br>A good front page can be seen on the right. All three news articles have pictures. As often happens with the lead feature, no picture could be obtained, so Layout had Art draw a picture that is related to the article (Art will sometimes give you a hard time over this. Make them do it. It's their job).<br>
<br>
The Opinion Pages<br>
<br>The editorial page is the only four column page in the issue. The editorial goes right above the masthead, once in a blue moon going beyond that pre-made box. The rest of the page is filled with letters to the editor and opinion pieces, which also fill the facing page. No photos go on these pages. Other than icons, the only non-text thing on these pages should be an editorial cartoon. If you need an editorial cartoon (for space reasons), ask the art department at the beginning of the week. Make sure it is actually an editorial cartoon, expressing an opinion on a relevant issue. If it isn't, ask Art for a new cartoon. Repeat until they get it right.<br>
<br>
The Back Page<br>

<br>This is where the lead Sports articles go, and follows all the rules the front page does. Instead of a lead feature, the left hand column should contain an Athlete Spotlight. Like the lead feature, it should be in a gray (7% shading) box with a three point text inset. Instead of a fourth article, there is often a photo for an article inside the Sports section, but not on the back page. Make sure this picture is completely independent from any articles on this page, with lines separating it from any bordering articles. It should also fall under no headline.<br>
<br>
The Rest of the Paper<br>
<br>Each page should contain 3-5 articles or ads (though some pages have full page of half page ads. Use your discretion). The key word in laying out articles is asymmetry. No two articles should end on the same line on a page. It's ugly. If two articles do do that, move one of them. Also, do not create a puzzle with the page. Each article, including pictures, outquotes and icons if they contain those things, should be rectangular in shape. Creating shapes out of Tetris, causing articles that interlock, is a big no-no. Articles are separated with lines, which are placed once the issue is completely laid out. Every now and then, instead of a horizontal line, you can use a horizontal icon to separate articles instead. Bylines should have one enter before them and two after them before the article begins. Bylines have their own font, found in the style menu. The writer's name should be completely capitalized. Two lines, known as byline lines (found in the The spectator library in Quark), should be placed around the byline once the issue is completely laid out.<br>
<br>Also important is breaking up text. Line upon line of text is boring to look at, so it should be broken up with photos, outquotes and icons. Photos go in the upper right hand part of an article, and should be at least one column thinner than the actual article. If the picture is the same number of columns wide, it goes above the article's headline, which is also acceptable. Outquotes go in the middle of articles, placed at your discretion. Icons can be placed in the middle of the article to break up text or at the end of an article to make the article longer. You can also place icons in between columns with a runaround of about three instead of the normal horizontal box. A good way to figure out if text needs to be broken up is to view at actual size and put your hand to the screen. If all your hand touches is text, it needs to be broken up.<br>
<br>While it is important to follow these rules, going by the same template every page, every issue can be boring. Sometimes, creative layout is in order. A good example of a creatively laid out page is shown at right. While breaking none of the rules said above, it is unique, containing only one article with a creatively laid out picture. Do this when possible, but never more than once in an issue, and also not every issue. Just use it as a nice change of pace every few issues (also, not exactly like the example every time, either).<br>
<br>
Icons <br>
<br>Use icons as a last resort. In all cases, outquotes and resizing of photos are preferable in filling a page. In a perfect world, we would get as many pictures as we need, and all articles would have a set length (in other words, if we were The New York Times), and we would not need icons. Unfortunately, that is not the case, so instead Art supplies us with a steady supply of these random non-sequiturs. Place them throughout the paper in the manner outlined above. Never repeat icons. No two issues should contain the same icons, though icons often do end up looking alike. They should be no longer than an inch in height (using the ruler that Quark provides), and should fill up most of their box. Aspect ratio change in icons is acceptable, but not excessively. Also, always save icons as bitmap files when saving them in Photoshop. It saves hard disk space, and causes less hassle.<br>
<br>Horizontal icons follow all the rules of normal icons, but are more than one column in length. They should never be used to break up text. Instead, they should be placed in between articles in place of horizontal lines, or at the bottom of articles to take up space left on the page. Like normal icons, they should be no taller than an inch and should fill their box. This is doubly important for horizontal icons, however, as they draw more attention than their normal counterparts.<br>
<br>
Photos<br>
<br>We saved the most difficult part for last. Photos are the most important part of Layout's job. If you screw up an article or an icon, while bad, it doesn't draw that much attention. Photos are the biggest attention getters in the paper, and therefore, if you screw them up, contain the most glaring mistakes you can make. There are two ways to go about sizing photos. On the one hand, you should do justice to the photos by making them big enough. On the other hand, you should resize photos according to the needs of the text on that page. <br>
<br>Once you get photos, you have to lighten them. If you don't, they'll be a big dark blob on the printed page. There are three ways to lighten photos in Photoshop: the brightness/contrast, curves and levels tools. Never use brightness/contrast. It's too inaccurate. Levels is probably the best way to fix a picture. Lighten the photo by first pressing the auto button, then dragging the three input levels arrows right and left. Right darkens, left lightens. Use mainly the middle arrow, though also use the right-most arrows and occasionally the left-most arrow, until the picture is as light as you would like. Then, lighten it a little more with the middle arrow. Finally, change the left Output Levels box from zero to anywhere from 10-40 in increments of ten. Only then will it be light enough.<br>
<br>When placing photos in layout, use the method outlined above. Never place photos above the byline. Always put a photo on the right hand side of an article. If the picture is a vertical photo, use either the one or two column box (you can find photo boxes, complete with spaces for captions and photo credit in the Spectator library file in Quark). If it is a horizontal photo, use either the three or, occasionally, four column box. Never change the aspect ratio of a photo. When sizing a photo, always make the horizontal size equal to vertical. A skewed aspect ratio for a photo is as ugly as you can get. Placing photos should be one of the last things you do to layout the paper. The boxes for photos should go in at the beginning, but they should only be filled with a picture at the end. That way, you don't have to change the size of a photo every time you change the size of its box. Once you've finished placing photos, all you have to do is add lines and byline lines. Then, you're home free.

<h3>Part 11</h3>

Photojournalism<br>
<br>Photojournalism is as important as the "word" journalism, if not more.  It is obvious that visual images will gladden any reader's eye; pages of unbroken text are quite intimidating to read.  Newspaper photographs are far more than just being an article's companion.  The photojournalist is ultimately, a specialized reporter.  As reporters, photojournalists must have a strong sense of the journalistic values that guide all reporters. Truthfulness, objectivity, and fairness are values that give the journalism profession credibility and respect. From getting the names spelled correctly in a group portrait to not misrepresenting yourself or a subject, truthfulness is a value that gives the public a reason to rely on the accuracy of the news they read and see in their newspaper. A photographer's credibility will suffer if personal opinions cloud their news judgment. To be fair, a journalist tries to show both sides of a controversial issue, takes photographs proportionate to their importance and tries to see each event as objectively as possible. A photographer should have a 35mm single lens reflex (SLR) camera, a pen and notebook for caption information, and a roll of film in handy.) <br>
<br>
Picture Perfect<br>

<br>A mature photojournalist will find a way to capture in photographs a fresh and decisive summation of the event. Successful picture taking is a combination of a strong news and visual sense. As reporters, photographers must use their sense of news judgment to determine if a certain subject is worth coverage and to present a fresh or unusual angle to an ordinary event. As visual recorders, photographers must use their sense of visual composition to eliminate distracting and unnecessary elements in the frame. As technicians, they must have a high level of expertise to use their machine to expose correctly and focus that peak news moment.<br>
<br>Photographers have several techniques they use to take pictures of people. They will either identify themselves immediately or wait until the subject asks for an explanation. There are two things that happen when you ask a person if you can take their picture and both of them are bad. Either they say no and you don't get the picture or they say yes and stare and smile at you like they were posing for a snapshot. When you see some unusual action, get an initial picture. Afterward, you can identify yourself, get their names, and take addition photographs after they become accustomed to your presence.<br>
<br>
Types of Photographs<br>
<br>There are six basic types of assignments a photographer faces. News, features, sports, portraits, illustrations, and picture stories each present a photographer with a different set of challenges.

<h3>Part 12</h3>

News is actually divided into two parts: spot and general. <br>
<br>
<br>A.  Spot News. Spot news is any unplanned event where little advanced planning is possible. Photographers will often learn of spot news events through a call from their photography editor or through coincidental circumstances.  <br>
<br>B.  General News. General news assignments give photographers a chance to prepare. A photographer's main concerns with such assignments are typically arriving on time to get a good vantage point, making sure that names in a group picture are spelled correctly, and having enough energy and curiosity to produce an unusual, yet telling moment. A picture of a teacher or student will always be more visually interesting if an emotional facial expression or hand gesture is captured on film. A standing group of people all smiling at the camera  is a visually dull image. Take care to find angles or activities that will not only show the physical appearance of a group, but will reveal their personalities. <br>
<br>Be on your toes. Even during the most banal news conference, strange events happen. It is difficult but a photojournalist must always be prepared for the unusual and the newsworthy. <br>
<br>
Features Assignments<br>

<br>There are two types of feature assignments: human interest and pictorial. <br>
<br>
<br>A.  Human Interest. These features show persons being natural and unique. The images cannot be anticipated. They are one of a kind moments that capture a person or group being themselves: odd, humorous, and natural. Cute kids, animals, and nuns are traditional subject cliches.<br> <br>Features offer an opportunity for a page to be highlighted with a pleasant, happy picture that may offset the tragic events of the day. A photographer looking for human interest features thinks like a hunter. Keenly aware and observant, knowledgeable on matters of basic human nature, quiet and unassuming, and technically competent to capture quick and fleeting moments, the photographer stalks the city looking for pictures that go beyond the cliche. <br>
<br>B. Pictorials. The other type of feature picture is the much maligned pictorial. Pictorials rely on the graphic elements of composition and lighting more than subject matter. Because feature assignment photographers often are their own reporters, much of the responsibility for the caption is left to the photographer. Names and locations are a minimal requirement. Quotations from subjects bring more interest to an otherwise ordinary picture/caption package and increase the chances for a front page photo spread. <br>
<br>
Sports Assignments<br>

<br>Although most persons would link photojournalism with news assignments, the most common assignment is actually sports. Sports assignments combine the action and excitement of news within a clearly defined structure. The key for successful sports photography is to know that structure. You have to be familiar with the rules of the game to predict dramatic moments. You should also know the backgrounds of some of the key players and anticipate their contribution. If you know that a rookie kicker is about to attempt his first field goal for an NFL team you should concentrate your lens on his sideline preparations. In an instant, his face may reveal his nervousness that would make a good picture. <br>
<br>Sports Action and Sports Feature are categories within the sports assignment. <br>
<br>A.  Sports Action.  Sports Action is a photograph of any moment that occurs on the playing field during the run of the game. <br>
<br>B.  Sports Feature.  Sports Feature is a picture that shows anything else: an angry coach in the locker room, a frustrated player on the sideline, an anxious fan in the stands. As implied by the name, the same procedure applies to sports feature hunting as with human interest features. A photographer tries to capture a peak, dramatic event not happening on the playing field. 
<br>(Tip:  keep track of key plays by shooting the scoreboard immediately afterward.)<br> <br>
Portrait/Headshot Assignments<br>
<br>Readers want to know what people in the news look like. The portrait assignment is an opportunity for photographers to capture a person's personality. It is no easy task. Important and ordinary newsmakers tend to hide behind a facade of friendliness. Seldom does a photographer get the luxury to spend long periods of time with a busy businessman. All the photographer's instincts and technical competence come into play to watch for a moment when the subject's personality is revealed. <br>
<br>There are two kinds of portrait pictures: mug and environmental. <br>
<br>A.  Head (Mug) Shots. Those little head and shoulder, close-up portraits. The challenge for photographers is to make the mug shot more than a picture of a subject smiling for the camera. Despite its small size, the picture can and should be a telling record.  (For the purposes of the Spectator, the photograph should have a light background to highlight the subject; a dark background will only make the image harder to view.) <br>
<br>B.  The Environmental Portrait. The environmental portrait not only shows what the subject looks like, but also reveals aspects of the sitter's personality by the foreground and background objects the person displays. Personal mementos on a desk or hung on a wall let the reader know more about the subject than a simple portrait can reveal. It is a picture of a person AND that person's environment-NOT simply a picture of a person in an environment. <br>
<br>Even if a pen and pencil set on a desk or a large, leafy, potted palm is in the way, avoid the temptation to move those objects. Part of the challenge of being a photojournalist is to work with the limitations that are presented during a shooting session. Distracting visual elements are a part of the subject's personality and should be left in the composition. <br>
<br>

Picture Story/Photo Essays, Roving Reporter Assignments<br>
<br>Picture Story/Photo Essays, and Roving Reporter Assignments give a photographer a chance to slow down and produce a package of pictures over a longer period of time. At its best, a picture story illuminates a serious social problem through the telling in words and pictures of a particular person's plight. <br>
<br>A. Picture Story/Photo Essay.  A picture story usually has five kinds of pictures: an overall scene-setter, a medium distance interaction, a portrait, a close-up, and an ending picture. The overall scene-setter describes in one picture the essence of the story. The photograph should readily place the main subject in the context for the reader. The medium distance interaction picture should show the subject communicating with some other person connected with the story. A portrait is usually a candid moment that reveals the subject's personality. The close-up photograph can be a tightly cropped detail of an object or a person that tends to symbolize the person's situation. Finally, the ending picture sums up and concludes the set of pictures. A photographer tells a story with words and pictures. There should be a logical beginning, middle, and end. <br>
<br>B.  Roving Reporter Assignments.  These photographs are less structured because they do not necessarily need beginning, middle and end photographs.  The assignments usually have a theme or question that the subject answers and the photographs should reflect the response given.

<h3>Part 13</h3>

Ethical behavior is taught by helping a photographer understand the underlying philosophies that shape a decision, by the ideals contained in a code of ethics, and through a discussion of specific situations. <br>
<br>Here are some questions to consider:<br>
- Is it the public's right to know?<br>
- Is the photograph essential to understanding the article?  Or is it unnecessary?<br>
- What is the effect to the person involved?<br>
- Are you putting the person in a false light under the public eye?<br>
- What is the significance to the presentation of the event?<br>
- What was the manner in which the photograph was obtained?<br>
- What are the positive reasons vs. negative aspects of publishing the photograph?  <br>
- Does the subject pose a conflict of interest?<br>
- Is it a teacher?  Member of administration or other higher position?  How will it affect that person's life?<br>
<br>A mother crying over the death of her daughter is not simply an image to be focused, a print to be made, and a picture to be published. The mother's grief is a lesson in humanity. If the photojournalist produces a picture without a thought for her tragedy, the lesson is lost. But if the photographer cares for her loss, is made more humane, and causes the readers to share in her grief, photojournalism has reached its highest potential.<br>
<br>A modem photojournalist is a mixture of reporter, artist, and craftsperson. A photographer is expected to determine in 1/500th of a second, whether a subject is newsworthy, aesthetically pleasing, and technically possible to record on film.  Photojournalists should be well-educated, curious, and cool under stressful situations. Photographers must also be humane, caring individuals aware of the many ethical concerns that are a part of any news assignment.

<h3>Part 14</h3>

What is Business?<br>
<br>The Spectator Business Department's main purpose is to ensure the financial security of the paper. By allowing the Spectator to remain financially independent, the Business Department prevents the paper from being dependent on the various groups that the paper may cover. The Business department also oversees all financial issues relating to the publication and production of the Spectator.<br>
What does the Business staff do?<br>
<br>Business Editor<br>
<br>The Business editor is in charge of the Business department and is responsible for all financial matters. Depending on circumstances, there will be two business editors each year. Editors must work together and come to a general consensus on all large financial issues. They are also responsible for budgets, bi-weekly reports, appropriations, and revenue accruing activities.<br>
<br>Business Staff<br>
<br>Staff members are divided into two sections.<br>
<br>Circulation: Members of the circulation section are in charge of mailing Spectator issues to subscribers.  The circulation section is headed by the circulation manager (CM).  The circulation manger reports only to the business editors and is responsible for increasing the paper's external circulation base.  The circulation staff is also in charge of sending copies of the newspaper to advertisers who wish to see proof of the publication of their ads.  <br>
<br>Business: All members of the business department are a part of this section for some duration of time.  Members of this section are involved in advertisement sales, bake sales, subscription sales, and any revenue accruing activities not listed.  Business editors will set a universal quota for members each fiscal year.  Members involved in the circulation section will have a reduced quota.<br>
<br>
Revenue<br>
<br>
