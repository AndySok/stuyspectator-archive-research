They&#8217;re made of sweat, determination and a hard-to-find alloy called guts. Few teams in Stuyvesant history could make this proverb more appropriate than the championship-winning wrestling teams of the 1980s.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, wrestling began in Stuyvesant as a club formed by the football coach at the time—Merle Thrush. Football players volunteered to belong to the club as a way to stay in shape during the winter before the football season. Thrush, himself, was a former wrestler at Oklahoma University and a wrestling coach at the New York Athletic Club, as well as a now legendary football coach who led the Peglegs to their last Public School Athletic League championship in an undefeated 1968 season.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1970s, wrestling became a much bigger sport, and consistent success came with its increased popularity in Stuyvesant. “We were serious contenders,” Jeffery Haber (’78) said. “Through the mid and late 70s we had solid teams, and the wrestlers who did not graduate with my class looked like they would have great success.”</p>
<p>In 1979 coach Martin Wasserman, the coach of the wrestling team throughout much of the 1970s, left to coach at DeWitt Clinton High School. Searching for a new coach, the team looked for candidates close to Stuyvesant. Several of the wrestlers who were also part of the football team recruited coach Doug Palczewski—then the assistant coach of the Stuyvesant Peglegs—as the new head coach of the wrestling team.</p>
<p>Immediately after inheriting a lackluster 0-8 team, he instilled a winning mentality, striving toward the championship every year—specifically through hard work. “Coach P[alczewski] sat down and said, ‘I don’t know anything about wrestling, but I know about conditioning,’” former captain Tom Berton (’83) said.</p>
<p>Palczewski implemented several of his football workouts, which included daily 3-hour-long practices consisting of pushups and close to 100 flights of stairs per day in the old 15th street Stuyvesant building. “We never met a team that was in better condition than us,” he said.</p>
<p>Palczewski also provided an encouraging and motivating attitude. “Coach [Palczewski] was a good coach and knew how to push your buttons to get the best out of each of us and his pre-practice speeches usually fired us up for the next team we were expected to demolish,” Jae-Bum Chung (‘86) said.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p>The team, then known as the Big Blue, soon received the tactical aid it needed, in the form of Mike Ognibene. A former New York State Wrestling champion and wrestler at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Ognibene graduated as a financial advisor and ended up working close to Stuyvesant. Interested in volunteering and helping out a local wrestling team, he was immediately recruited by Stuyvesant prior to the 1980-81 season.  “We became the perfect match. He knew the wrestling moves, but he didn’t know how to teach them well, and I developed a system where he’d show me the move and I’d know how to drill it,” Palczewski said.</p>
<p>“The dominance of the team came from the fact that coach [Palczewski] and [Ognibene] focused on skill and stamina rather than brute strength.  Many matches were fought where the winner was the smaller person because he was able to outlast the opponent,” Don Wade (’86) said.</p>
<p>After decent success in the early 1980s, everything finally seemed to click for Palczewski and the Big Blue in the 1982-83 season. He had at last perfected his system of coaching by modeling other successful programs at DeWitt Clinton and Stevenson High Schools. The rejuvenated program would be tested that season in matches against the two perennial powerhouses. Surprisingly enough, the Big Blue managed to beat Stevenson by a score of 34-24. Later that season, the Big Blue won again against DeWitt Clinton, 44-25, in the highly anticipated away match.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Big Blue was entering the playoffs with an undefeated 8-0 record. Breezing through the first few rounds, it faced some resistance in the semifinals against Far Rockaway High School. After its top four wrestlers lost in their matches, Stuyvesant had to count on its three most inconsistent wrestlers—Tom Leonardi (‘83), Gian Stagnaro (’83) and Tom Clancy (’83). In an unimaginable performance, all three won and the Big Blue went on to win 47-22. “We were actually happy those four guys lost,” Leonardi said. “It showed that the other guys could carry us, and would also wrestle at the same level again.”</p>
<p>The Big Blue then entered the finals against Tottenville High School, whose top three wrestlers were among the best in the city. Stuyvesant jumped out to an early lead, up 25 points with five matches to go, including the last three against those very three dominant wrestlers. Assuming that the last three would pin their Stuyvesant opponent, earning them 6 points each and 18 points total, the Big Blue had to avoid being pinned in the next two matches to mathematically clinch the victory.</p>
<p>Ironically enough, the complex mathematics learned only in Stuyvesant, which was lost on the referee, led to the eventual downfall of the Big Blue. After avoiding being pinned in the subsequent two matches, the wrestlers began celebrating for a reason unbeknownst to the referee, who then proceeded to subtract one point for unsportsmanlike conduct. As expected, the next three wrestlers were pinned by Tottenville’s big three, ending the match in a 30-30 tie. The two schools were co-champions. “We felt like we got robbed, but looking back, we still were the city champions,” Leonardi said. “We didn’t lose it, we just had to share it.” That first city championship proved that Stuyvesant could always overcome the odds and perceptions. “It was a bunch of smart kids, supposedly, a bunch of nerds and that was the image that they had of us. People began taking us seriously because they were losing to us,” Berton said.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the average SAT score of the team in 1983 was a 1386 out of 1600, Stuyvesant eventually became the team to beat. Palczewski changed the name of the team to the Warriors in order to establish a new, tough physique and perception of the team. “Stuyvesant became the model of how to run a team. Every other team that had to compete with us had to improve their knowledge of different wrestling techniques,” he said.</p>
<p>Another factor in the success of the team was the great support shown by the Stuyvesant community. Cramped in a tiny gym in the old Stuyvesant building, fans consistently filled the second-tier seating on the track above the gym, giving the team an immense home-field advantage during meets. “It seemed like we were the most popular team in the school,” Berton said. “The home matches were really packed.”</p>
<p>“I remember having the band come out for a rally on the playoff meets.  It is always fun performing in front of friends and family, especially the girls we were chasing,” Chung said.</p>
<p>Fueled by raging hormones and a will to win, the Warriors continued their success, reaching the playoffs the next two seasons.</p>
<p>The team continued to distance itself from the stereotype of a group of scrawny nerds, and continued to intimidate the opposition. “The gym went dark when they began and the song &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; by Black Sabbath started to play. Three spotlights came on and ended up shining on the middle of the mat. Then our captains stepped onto the mat and into the spotlights. It was very showy but I think it did what we wanted it to do, which was to intimidate our opponents. All of our matches were designed to intimidate psychologically before the first match even began,” Wade said.</p>
<p>The 1985-86 season led to another miraculous city-championship—the team&#8217;s second one of the decade. In the finals, the Warriors once again faced Far Rockaway High School, where Chung upset the Rockaway captain Omar Ortega—the stud and pride of Queens. The victory unleashed a hail of insults from the Rockaway crowd. After their match, the Warriors were escorted out of the building by the referee Paul Goddard, who was a transit cop by day.</p>
<p>The Warriors continued their unbelievable success and went on to repeat and win the city championship in both the 1987 and 1988 season, building a dynasty rarely seen in those days at Stuyvesant. Both Palczewski and Ognibene continued to coach throughout the decade, though the triumphs of the early 80s teams were never fully recreated. “It felt great that I had the opportunity to be in the history books,” Palczewski said. “I had the opportunity to be a part of Stuyvesant history.”</p>

			<p>The first line (Gold medals aren’t really made of gold. They’re made of sweat, determination and a hard-to-find alloy called guts.) is a direct quote from Dan Gable(Wrestling great and former Iowa head coach). A quality institution such as yours should know proper rules of composition require quotation marks and proper citation given.</p>
