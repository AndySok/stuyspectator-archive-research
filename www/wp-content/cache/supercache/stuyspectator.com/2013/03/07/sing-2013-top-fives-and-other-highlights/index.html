            		<p><strong>BEST ACTORS</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Roger Lee (as the 8th Sin)</span></p>
<p>Roger Lee controlled the stage during Senior SING! with competent acting, believable reactions, and consistent emotions that made his character extremely sympathetic. What set Roger apart from SING!’s other actors, however, was his humility. He did not attempt to dominate the stage or use loudness to compensate for skill and crazy gestures to avoid expressing what his character was feeling. In one word, Roger was genuine. He understood the pathos of his character and expressed it effortlessly enough to win over the audience by the end of the first scene.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Gene Gao (as Sebastian the Crab)</span></p>
<p>Gao’s humorous stage presence allowed him to steal the show through his convincing accent, inability to say tongue twisters, and wonderfully exaggerated facial expressions. From his excellent imitations of a dancing crab to his valiant portrayal of a crab who only wants recognition, Gao brings his character into the spotlight and away from his scripted, minute role. He complements and supports the incompetent “Feeble Five” even in the depths of the sea, driving Gao toward the heroism both he and his character deserve.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Phoebe Young (as Envy)</span></p>
<p>Young had fewer lines than her counterparts, but she made the most of every moment on stage. She threw herself into her role as the nervous, greedy, and flat-out weird sin. Envy spoke with a stumbling yet distinct drawl that Pride mocks as sounding like she has a hairball in her throat. When Young wasn’t emphatically performing her lines, she was in the background stroking other characters’ hair and circling them with the wide eyes and awkward posture of a freak. The leads of Senior SING! were often overshadowed by Young, as she displayed devotion and fearlessness in her approach to her role.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Theo Klein (as Inspector Clouseau)</span></p>
<p>Theo Klein had the audience dying of laughter throughout the entire soph-frosh performance. From his flirting with Sherlock Holmes to his audacious dancing to his limitless ability to surprise, Klein proved unafraid to leave his comfort zone. Free-spirited and spontaneous, he brought a great deal of character into his role and cohesion to Soph-Frosh SING! with his caricatured mannerisms.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5: Nick Kaidoo (as Roger the Pirate)</span></p>
<p>Kaidoo’s impressive acting brought Roger the Pirate to life, from his booty-seeking to his romantic and sweet love story. Kaidoo’s execution of clever lines, such as the “Titanic” allusion and his references to George Clooney, brought comedic relief to the normally weighty persona that pirates carry. In addition, Kaidoo’s versatile talent allowed him to portray lovey-dovey and dramatic scenes equally well. With confidence and swagger, he easily crafted within his role the domineering aura found in all pirates.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honorable Mentions:</span></p>
<p>- Emmalina Glinskis, Clarissa Sorenson, Eugenie Thompson (Three Furies)<br />
The few lines of the Three Furies of Senior SING! were delivered impeccably. These three actresses had incredible an chemistry that made their roles entertaining. Ultimately, their performances, not only in acting but also in singing, provided a beautiful deviation from the eight sins.</p>
<p>- Philip Chun (Shaggy)<br />
There is no way to describe Chun’s acting except “cute.” The decision to cast him as Shaggy was one of the best the soph-frosh directors made; his relationship with Scooby Doo was nothing short of authentic and reminiscent of the close friendship between these two characters in the actual TV and movie series.</p>
<p>- Ethan Schwab (Pirate &amp; Leslie)<br />
Ethan’s small role was amplified by his hilariously flamboyant caricatures and body language.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>BEST DANCES</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Senior Boys&#8217; Hip Hop</span></p>
<p>Melding the visual effects of the strobe lights with the rhythm held energetically by the band, Pride’s break-dancers entered with a flamboyance maintained through the entire routine. Exemplifying Pride’s narcissism well, the crew bathed in the audience’s applause, pulling off consecutive acrobatic maneuvers and amazingly well-orchestrated breakdancing stunts.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Junior Step</span></p>
<p>Wittily introduced with a Spongebob reference, these scallywags integrated an innovative one-legged “Peglegs” step as well as a synchronized Irish jump for a routine that was both loud and energetic enough to sink any regular pirate ship. The crew ruled the seas with their consistently forceful claps and stomps and creative rhythms.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Senior Indian</span></p>
<p>Director Sreshta Paranji took a team of inexperienced seniors and taught them to move with poise and flair in this cultural dance. Smiling performers exuded infectious energy and enthusiasm every second on stage as they bounced to the Indian hit “Salaam Namaste.”  The largest Indian dance crew in recent memory trumped all expectations to propel the seniors to victory.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Junior Latin</span></p>
<p>Atlantis’ best dancers impressed with a choreography replete with amazingly synchronized lifts and spins. An ensuing solo performance led by Sylwia Jemielity, Sean Zhou, Christine Xu, and Samuel Fuchs showcased even more professionalism and talent as the group of four wowed audiences with their speed and fluidity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Senior Swing</span></p>
<p>A spicy performance involving quick leaps, twists, and turns fired up the crowd as a superstar set of seniors expertly executed one of the most complex choreographies of any SING!. Each pair of partygoers integrated grace and dynamism into its steps, reflecting the flair of the senior plot.</p>
<p><strong>BEST SONGS</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. “Toxic” (Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>Senior SING!’s chorus delivered this catchy Britney song perfectly. Featuring sass and the strong voices of the three Furies, “Toxic” integrated a melodious rhythm with evil undertones to bring out the Underworld’s true colors, along with a memorable choreography that adds to the fright-inducing effect. Accompanied by a band arrangement that equals, if not exceeds, the original soundtrack, the sinners’ voices culminate in a shiver-inducing recognition of the toxicity of Fury’s plans.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. “Radioactive” (Junior SING!)</span></p>
<p>Complemented visually by contemporary dance and an ominous fog, junior chorus quickly captivated the audience with “Radioactive” as their opening number. Evoking a gloomy mood as though to reflect the ensuing storm, the chorus of sailors and sirens incorporated a powerful male base with swirling melodies from both genders in a song that rises and falls from tranquil to tumultuous.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. “Serenata Immortale” (Junior SING!)</span></p>
<p>In their introduction of the Anglerfish, junior chorus captures the silent, haunting nature of the depths of the sea in this beautifully arranged number. Alternating between a strong bass foundation and wispy calls from the chorus’s sopranos, the song fully features the range of the juniors’ vocal capabilities as well as the band’s epic and moving arrangements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. “Settle Down” (Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>In a powerful performance from the senior chorus, the audience is introduced to the realms of the Underworld. In creating an underworld-appropriate atmosphere, this song truly set the standard for the rest of the show with its quietly rising intensity and haunting percussive underbelly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. &#8220;Run The Underworld&#8221; (Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>Multiple layers of harmony introduced this number as Lust’s belly dancers seduced the audience. With calls and cries alternating from the left and right halves of the chorus, the seniors put together a fierce rendition of Beyonce’s “Run the World (Girls)” with a strong bass component that contrasted effectively with the piercing voices of the chorus’s sopranos.</p>
<p><strong>BEST SOLO SONGS</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. “Sweet Escape” (by Jasmine Aurora Thomas, Soph-Frosh SING!)</span></p>
<p>Caught for stealing the Pink Panther diamond, Velma (Jasmine Aurora Thomas) sings her solo out of spite for her fellow detectives and the “meddling kids” who foiled her plot for mere recognition. Thomas’s incredibly strong and jazzy vocals, accompanied by Nancy Drew (Harmehar Kohli), Cam Jansen (Kristen Chang), Genie Gorbonosov, and chorus director Sunnam Quispe, engaged audiences with her emotional take on Gwen Stefani’s hit and gained this solo the title of the number one solo song.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. “If Only” (by Clarissa Sorenson, Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>When Eighth Sin bids goodbye to Fury due to her meddling with the competition, Fury (Clarissa Sorenson) breaks into song to declare her newfound love for him. Sorenson’s performance is both charming and heartfelt as Fury convinces Eighth Sin to let her be his queen.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. “Titanium” (by Emily Hamilton, Junior SING!)</span></p>
<p>When the “Feeble Five” attempt to bring Sylvia back to the Mermaid Queen, she adamantly refuses to listen, providing her rebellious reasons in a heartfelt and powerful solo. Hamilton’s performance not only connected to the strong teenage spirit but succeeded at blowing away the entire audience.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. &#8220;Settle Down&#8221; Solo (by Jane Kim, Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>As the curtains pull back, Senior SING! invites the audience to “come on down” with them into the underworld. It’s Jane Kim’s haunting vibrato, supported by Ellie Abrams and Julia Stemmer, that seals our souls in the Underworld and brings a quiet, dramatic flair to the seniors’ introductory scene.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. “I Knew You Were Trouble” (by Kristen Chang, Soph-Frosh SING!)</span></p>
<p>Though Cam Jansen (Kristen Chang) played one of the smaller roles in Soph-Frosh SING!, her voice amazed audiences during all three shows. Following her character’s rejection by Shaggy, Chang brings out her inner Taylor Swift and as the spotlight is turned on her, with a powerful vibrato emphasizing her newfound independence.</p>
<p><strong>BEST LINES</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. &#8220;In hell you can only have two of these three things: torture, suffering, and eternal suffering.&#8221; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">—Hades (Bernie Birnbaum, Senior SING).</span></p>
<p>The audience roared with nostalgia and laughter in Birnbaum’s accurate take on the famous catchphrase that former Principal Stanley Teitel told every incoming freshman.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Well, I specifically asked you to clean the deck, and you just stomped around on it.” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">—Roger (Nick Kaidoo, Junior SING!)</span></p>
<p>This quip was a humorous tie-in after an incredible step performance.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. “I’m gonna go sleep this off in the park. Don’t worry, I’ll clean up after myself.” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">—Sloth (Howard Cheung, Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>Sloth references a recent e-mail from Principal Jie Zhang after he is eliminated from the competition to become the next ruler of the Underworld.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;You&#8217;re the worst thing to happen to this ocean since BP. [pause] Never Forget.&#8221; —Junior SING! cast</span></p>
<p>Gene Gao’s witty line criticizes Cliff while cleverly referencing the BP oil spill of 2010. Cast members humorously came together for a unified salute and moment of silence in remembrance of the event.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 5. “I’ll follow in the footsteps of legends like Monica Lewinsky, Yoko Ono, and Ryan Seacrest!” —Fury (Clarissa Sorenson, Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>Fury underscores her diabolical plan to become queen of the underworld with this comical line, comparing herself to three other great American figures who preceded her.</p>
<p><strong>BEST DISSES</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. “</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I’ve committed the worst of all sins&#8230;” “(gasps) JUNIOR SING!?” —a junior and Hades (Tasnim Ahmed and Bernie Birnbaum, Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>The seniors’ extended introduction consisted of a clever string of disses aimed at the fishy and apparently sinful Junior SING!.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Sachin Surendra’s cameo as a lost freshman in Junior SING!</span></p>
<p>Surendra’s portrayal of a freshman dissing the juniors is turned against Soph-Frosh SING! as he is reduced to tears and led off to find his Big Sib.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. “Yeah, seriously, where did you get that gross outfit? The trash?” “The Senior SING! costume crew made it for me!</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">—Nancy Drew and Velma (Harmehar Kohli and Jasmine Aurora Thomas, Soph-Frosh SING!)</span></p>
<p>Soph-Frosh takes a jab at the seniors by attributing Velma’s trademark orange sweater to the work of the senior’s costume crew.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. &#8220;Release the Kraken!&#8230; Oh wait, nothing happened&#8230;&#8221; —Greed (Michael Evans, Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>The seniors directly criticize an anticlimactic scene in Junior SING!, in which the queen orders the Feeble Five to “release the Kraken.” In the juniors’ performance, a door falls but is pulled back immediately after a blackout, causing much confusion over the necessity of the scene.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. (Clouseau is awakened by a fish) “Oh, that’s terrible!” —Inspector Clouseau (Theo Klein, Soph-Frosh SING!)</span></p>
<p>After fainting from the realization that his diamond is gone, Clouseau is awakened from his coma by a reeking fish from Junior SING!.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Diamond Chase: Theo Klein, Jaishankar, and Maggio (Soph-Frosh SING!)</span></p>
<p>Accompanied by soph-frosh chorus’s rendition of “Diamonds,” this scene engaged the entire audience. Despite not delivering any lines, biology teacher Marissa Maggio and mathematics teacher Ashvin Jaishankar had the audience turning its heads from side to side as they sprinted across the auditorium with a clumsy Inspector Clouseau (Theo Klein) chasing after them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Park’s Mirror Cameo (Senior SING!)</span></p>
<p>Mathematics teacher David Park’s cameo as Pride’s (Nick Miller) mirror reflection was possibly the most amusing scene of SING! 2013. His performance stirred loud screams and hoots from the audience as he flexed, posed, and admired himself in Miller’s mirror.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step Solo (Freshman Peter Samuel, Soph-Frosh SING!)</span></p>
<p>Despite the unoriginal start to the Soph-Frosh step routine, Samuel proved to be the savior of the crew through his wildly impressive solo, leaving the audience stunned by his rapid-fire movements and consistent beat. Samuel’s smooth moves and passion transformed his body into a beatbox, attracting the attention of steppers and non-steppers alike.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drums (Tyler Small, Soph-Frosh SING!)</span></p>
<p>One of the most talented band members in Soph-Frosh SING!, drummer Tyler Small infused energy into Kristen Chang’s rendition of  “I Knew You Were Trouble” with an enthusiastic performance that far outmatched the beats in the original song. It’s unfortunate that no one except those in the first row could see the band in action; Small is definitely a musician to look out for in future SING! performances.</p>
