This year, Soph-Frosh SING! hopped on the Mystery Machine to thwart the naysayers who’ve<strong> </strong>repeatedly<strong> </strong>deemed Soph-Frosh productions mediocre. While errors from past showcases continued to plague them, the sophomores and freshmen have begun to crack the mystery behind a trailing, third-place Soph-Frosh performance. With impressive acting, solid numbers, and a theme transcending trite Stuyvesant references, Soph-Frosh SING! 2013 serves as a reminder that our underclassmen have great potential, and are more than capable of putting on a good show.</p>
<p>The production opens with an assortment of notable mystery characters reading an invitation from Inspector Clouseau, who wishes to share his Pink Panther diamond with his fellow detectives.  After a spunky rendition of &#8220;Everybody Talks,&#8221; the chorus (directed by sophomores Sunnam Quispe and Marcus Chan) gives way to Inspector Clouseau, who introduces himself to the convened detectives with an uninspiring performance of &#8220;Master of the House.&#8221; Though the song choice is sensible, the number’s dull and repetitive melody did little to showcase the budding vocal abilities of the chorus. Though the song didn’t impress, Clouseau made up for it. Sophomore Theo Klein is the show&#8217;s main source of comic relief; his thick French accent and overt mannerisms evoked plenty of laughs from the audience. However, Clouseau’s Parisian drawl made some of his lines difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Before Inspector Clouseau unveils the Pink Panther, the audience is introduced to the oddball cast of detectives. Velma (sophomore Jasmine Aurora Thomas), Shaggy (freshman Philip Chun), and Scooby Doo (sophomore Thomas Perskin) are plucked straight out of the Mystery Machine – Velma is a quirky, sensitive nerd, Shaggy&#8217;s goofiness is exacerbated by his love for Scooby Snacks, and Scooby is still the beloved and devoted canine of the original series. Sherlock Holmes (sophomore Maksym Bondarenko) is an egregious narcissist who becomes the subject of Clouseau&#8217;s affection. They&#8217;re joined by Frank and Joe Hardy (sophomores Coby Goldberg and Darien Cox), the &#8220;swagful&#8221; prepubescent duo; Cam Jansen (freshman Kristen Chang), a cutesy hipster who is obsessed with vintage clothing; and Nancy Drew (sophomore Harmehar Kohli), the flirtatious embodiment of sass who makes the one &#8220;Mean Girls&#8221; reference of the night. The performances of the cast were impressive; each actor had a firm grasp over his or her character and enthusiastically livened up the occasionally over-simplistic script. The character’s costumes were fitting (especially Scooby’s realistic dog costume and makeup) but for the most part just enough to casually distinguish each persona.</p>
<p>The set, however, was far more appealing than last year’s barren Soph-Frosh set.  Though the main feature was simply a staircase leading down onto the stage, Clouseau’s mansion displays impressive pieces of artwork, including a life-like portrait of Clouseau himself, and a painting of an ornate chandelier in the background that compensate for the lack of depth in the scenery. The table of “cross-ants,” kitchenware, and Scooby Snacks provided a fanciful, additional feature to the mansion’s singular representation of multiple rooms.</p>
<p>A tiff between Sherlock and Nancy leads to the first dance number of the night. Girls’ Hip-Hop (directed by sophomores Julia Gokhberg and Bo Eun Chang) dished out a respectable performance to &#8220;Love Lockdown,&#8221; but the awkwardness of their transition was unnerving. In fact, most of the dance crews either had no introduction or no tie-in to the plot, drilling holes into the performance’s overall energy and cohesiveness.</p>
<p>The time comes for Clouseau to reveal the Pink Panther diamond. The big reveal is accompanied by a sultry jazz performance of girls dressed in pink<strong> </strong>(directed by sophomores Danielle Isakov and Nadia Saleh) that was both well-choreographed and amusing, what with Clouseau&#8217;s unexpected participation in the dance. The number concludes with a dramatic flourish: the glass case that holds the diamond is uncovered, but the diamond has disappeared. Clouseau faints, only to be woken up by a shark doll—one of the many well-executed jabs at the other SING! performances. Clouseau imposes a lockdown on the house and sets the stage for Boys’ Hip-Hop (directed by sophomores Sadman Fahmid, Joshua Chan, and Brian Tran) to perform an upbeat yet disappointingly short routine that meshed well with the fast-paced song choice.</p>
<p>Velma discovers a blue paw-print on the glass case and all suspicions immediately befall Scooby, who conveniently disappears. As a stand-in for Scooby, the step crew (directed by sophomores Crystal Cheng and Brian Guo) was outfitted and made up to look like dogs, cleverly entering with &#8220;Who Let the Dogs Out.” Step lacked the dynamism and volume of the other grades’ crews; however, a true highlight was the inclusion of a solo during which freshman Peter Samuel sent the crowd roaring with a fast-paced, intense routine.</p>
<p>Shaggy and Cam are now left alone to search for Scooby. Cam assures Shaggy that they will eventually find Scooby, and makes her interest in him glaringly evident. As Cam leans in for a kiss, the pair comically falls through a secret passageway hidden behind a movable bookshelf – a clever touch by the set designers. Soph-Frosh Latin (directed by Isakov) performs a routine meant to symbolize the potential romance between Cam and Shaggy. While the choreography lacked complexity, the crew maintained the energy of the band’s rendition of “Mr. Saxobeat” with their synchronized footwork and strings of twirls and turns, proving that this is a crew to watch in coming performances.</p>
<p>While Clouseau, Holmes, and Velma wonder as to how they&#8217;ll resolve the mystery (and Clouseau indefatigably flirts with Holmes), Velma begins to act strangely, inciting the suspicious Holmes to question her motives.  Despite his loud-mouthed pride and stinging comments, he is quite perceptive and discreetly picks Velma’s fallen glasses up before the three crime-solvers exit to search the attic of Clouseau&#8217;s mansion.</p>
<p>The next musical number, a rendition of &#8220;Diamonds&#8221; by Rihanna, is well-executed but out of place. The chorus is featured alongside Clouseau, who runs around the theater chasing a faculty advisor (either biology teacher Marissa Maggio or mathematics teacher Ashvin Jaishankar) carrying the precious diamond. The audience got a kick out of watching Clouseau trip over himself, but the unexplained scene dragged on amidst vocals and an arrangement that didn’t do enough justice to Rihanna&#8217;s ballad.</p>
<p>In the next scene, the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew meander onto the stage, also looking for “clues” (wink, wink).  The Hardy Boys break into a cute take on &#8220;Ice Ice Baby&#8221; by Vanilla Ice and receive a swagger boost from Boys’ Hip-Hop members in the background.  Nancy finds a note, supposedly written by Shaggy to Cam, making clear his intention of leaving Scooby in a pound. Sherlock takes the note and discreetly fiddles with it without much notice, eventually giving it to the unsuspecting Velma to “read” it.</p>
<p>Soph-Frosh Indian (directed by sophomores Radhika Kaicker and Anise Rau) mystifies Cam, Shaggy, and even the audience; despite being set in Clouseau’s treasure room, the complete lack of context was especially disorienting. The girls’ moves were simplistic, and the dance seemed to be another forced addition into the plot.</p>
<p>Chun, evidently a comically-inclined actor, evokes Shaggy’s inner stoner with the line, “My bud, where is my bud?! I’ve never gone so long without my bud.” Cam’s one-sided romantic pursuit of Shaggy is believable and cute, but leans toward a tween Disney movie. Shaggy and Cam suddenly find Scooby, prompting Shaggy to sing the Scooby Doo theme song and evoking nostalgia from the audience. In a heartwarming moment, Scooby gives Shaggy a high five with a friendly, “What’s good bro?” Cam is evidently disappointed by their reunion, and is convincingly hurt when Shaggy tells Scooby: “I would never leave you for Cam.”</p>
<p>As the lights dim, Cam begins to evoke her broken hearted soul sister Taylor Swift with a rendition of “I Knew You Were Trouble.” Chang&#8217;s vocals, though not perfect, were powerful, and the band (including the notably skilled drummer Tyler Small) put all its energy into the bombastic song.</p>
<p>The reunited Mystery Machine duo and downcast Cam then meet up with the rest of the gang, when Sherlock reveals that the diamond thief was Velma.  He explains to the shocked detectives that Velma planted the fake note from Shaggy to get Scooby to flee, substantiating his accusation by telling the group that he switched Velma’s original note with a blank sheet of paper. Velma tries to escape, but the Soph-Frosh rave crew (directed by sophomores Theo Lipeles and Barak Zhou) stops her with a repetitive routine that consisted primarily of basic wrap-combos but was spruced up by a few well-executed solos.</p>
<p>Velma, in the crosshairs of the detectives, breaks into song with Gwen Stefani&#8217;s “Sweet Escape.” Thomas is an excellent performer and truly out-shined every other singer in the production with her powerful voice. Her execution of the difficult song was astounding, establishing her as a young performer to look out for. However, as Velma tells the others that she stole the diamond due to feelings of under-appreciation, her powerful number is brought to a lackluster conclusion. Velma concludes the show: “And I would’ve gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for you meddling kids and SOPH-FROSH SING!&#8221;</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the Soph-Frosh performance centered on an uneventful and scattered plot further lost in a mix of awkward, empty transitions and only decent performances. Velma’s motive for stealing the diamond seemed oversimplified and dashed out, appending an unsatisfying ending to an otherwise cartoonish plot.  The cast, however, exceeded expectations.  With robust acting and a clever script, it inched the production ever so slightly closer to being a threat to other performances. Here comes along down Mystery Lane a Soph-Frosh SING! proving that underclassmen too can put on a show that&#8217;s a diamond in the rough.</p>
