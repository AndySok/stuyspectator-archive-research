            		<p>With a theme of “the zoo” and rumors of a SING! worse than sophfrosh, Junior SING! opened to low expectations. But with a clever script and a wider message, this year’s production, put on by executive producer Sharon Cho and producers Saru Nanda, Maggie Wu, and Catalina Piccato, gave a roaring performance.</p>
<p>The production opens with a scene of Zookeeper (Eliza Mitnick) introducing the newest attraction, the Canadian Arctic Fox (Ian Outhwaite). Mitnick brings a spunky energy to the stage, but her Australian accent is on and off during her short opening. After the Zookeeper exits (“Stay in your cages! They always do,” she says), a gruff Gorilla (Joshua Bogatin) comes to explain how the zoo really works and urges Fox to come out of his cage and see for himself.</p>
<p>Fox leaves his cage and the curtains open to reveal a well constructed, though simplistic set. A brick entrance to Zooccotti Park- -a clever play on Zuccotti Park, the center of the New York Occupy Wall Street movement&#8211;is placed in front of a backdrop of tropical trees. What stands out on set are the costumes (directed by Rosen Jeong and Teresa Huang). The costumes, rather than recreate the animals entirely, use simple representations (like the feathers of a bird or the paw print of a gorilla) to show what animal it is. They are colorful and functional, without being ridiculous Halloween costumes.</p>
<p>The chorus (directed by Ellie Abrams and Carolyn Kang), well dressed in brightly colored bird costumes and feathery headdresses, flaps to the rhythm of “Paradise” by Coldplay. The song lyrics are inaudible at times but are rescued by the strong chorus and drum accompaniment. While the chorus sings the opening number, contemporary dance (directed by Florence Gafanovich and Julia Magliozzo) imitate the graceful prancing of gazelles for their own act. The choreography smoothly incorporated acrobatics with the fluid movements of contemporary dance, but wasn’t perfectly synchronized. Unfortunately, the elbow stands and kickovers were poorly timed, hindering what effect they could have added. The arabesque and pirouettes, especially the duo performance, were carried out well, but as the dance number dragged on, certain movements became repetitious and boring.</p>
<p>Outhwaite shines in his role as the naive yet empathetic Fox who desperately wants to liberate the animals from their oppression after discovering the true nature of the zoo’s affairs. Complete with relevant political jokes (“How does one get in debt in a zoo?” “He’s Greek. He figured it out.”), the script (written by Meg Palmer, Josh Bloom, Michael Evans, Eugenie Thompson, and Ivy Wanta) uses the dynamics in the zoo as an allegory for the social upheaval that has surrounded students since September. The plot’s connection to OWS adds a familiar element to the classic tale of the oppressed gathering together in revolt to overtake their corrupt governors.</p>
<p>As Gorilla continues his rationing, Fox spots the sleek and beautiful lioness Steph, Lou’s daughter (Lucy Woychuk-Mlinac) and her Cheetahs, the girls’ hip-hop crew (directed by Christy Ku). The dance begins in circle formation around Steph, and smoothly transitions to various line formations. The formations exhibited a full mastery of stage space (dancers rotated on and off stage so as not to crowd the dance area). Despite some excessive head swinging, the performance was upbeat and energetic. The choreography included cute growl-like motions to mimic cheetah behavior.</p>
<p>The scene then opens on Steph and zoo patriarch Lou (Patrick So). Woychuk-Mlinac portrays the stereotypical teenager, begging to go to a concert. When told no, she storms offstage. Lou then launches into a monologue defending his position, revealing the easy lifestyle of the rich. At the end of his tirade, he introduces the tap crew (directed by Tony Scott) represented by four tapping and finger-snapping zebras and a beat-boxing monkey (Sean Chee). The routine, performed to the tune of “Weapon of Choice” by Fatboy Slim utilizes clear and simple formations to emphasize the footwork itself.</p>
<p>It’s at this concert that the two soon-to-be revolutionaries meet. Fox and Steph meet and in a comparatively explosive scene come to realize that the system must change. Outhwaite and Woychuk-Mlinac have great energy but the emotional progression of this scene is poorly developed. Steph almost instantly switches from aggressive to apologetic. Her sudden “guilt” for being rich comes out of the blue, especially after coming from a concert funded by her daddy. The lack of explanation for her change of heart hindered the audience’s ability to believe the plot.</p>
<p>The two, having developed a close friendship within a few short minutes somehow in a common cliche, seek evidence from Sal the Snake (Michael Evans) to take down Lou.</p>
<p>Indian dance creates the transition between the concert and Sal’s hideout. The choreography is very traditional and shows a great use of stage space. The dance seemed rushed at times but was rescued by the enthusiasm and aptitude of directors Sreshta Paranji and Shreya Kalva as well as a strong musical accompaniment.</p>
<p>At the reptile house, Evans’s performance as an old lecherous snake is spot on, with a great raspy voice and bent over posture. Sal summons his beautiful secretaries (are they humans or animals? It’s never explained.) and Belly Dance (directed by Stephanie Yakoubovitch) enters. The dance is short but elegant. The choreography is simple but still exhibits the technique of the dancers involved. Starting off slow, the dancers speed up midway and move between paces at ease. The scene ends with Fox and Steph leaving with the evidence necessary to impeach Lou.</p>
<p>The Fox and Lioness meet in front of a crowd of animals to kindle a revolution for the turning point of the plot. What follows is a clever reference back to the Occupy Wall Street movement: the announcement is repeated in small fragments in unison to ensure that the message resonates through and is heard by the entire crowd.</p>
<p>The Chorus lined the stage in two halves to make way for rapping giraffe Nick Miller and singing cat Vivian Xue. The lyrics themselves are tailored wonderfully for the performance including lines such as “The fox is no curse, forget the Earth, he’s got the urge/ to pull us outta the dirt, and fox the whole universe,” referring back to the fox’ upheaval of the zoo’s current system. Xue complements the rap with her singing to deliver the last verse before a final chorus.</p>
<p>The newly formed rebellion is dispersed by the police and step begins their routine. Step was easily one of the best examples of the juniors’ vivacity and ability to place first. The performers lined the stage in rows and were completely in sync. The routine started off full blast with energetic choreography and pizazz. Performers smoothly divide into thirds to shift into the next part of their routine where only a single group stepped while the rest watched. It was a cohesive performance that really utilized every single member with each change of formation and line shift.</p>
<p>In another tribute to Occupy Wall Street politics, an owl from BBC news (Clarissa Sorenson) and Fox news fox (Emmalina Glinskis) comment on the recent happenings through two completely contradictory perspective. Glinskis and Sorenson finish each others’ sentences and humorously portray the differences between the left and right wings of media.</p>
<p>After hearing of the uprising and his daughter’s involvement, Lou fumes and introduces Boys Hip Hop. These dancing monkeys left little space for anything but applause. Although the performance wasn’t perfectly synchronized, it more than made up for it with its electrifying choreography. The dancers performed as a group while also leaving time for individual moves with the sole intent to dazzle. The group visibly fed off each other’s energy and worked together. There was even a perfectly executed lined version of the “running man” and a brief line dance incorporated into the routine. Between all the handstands, flips, and kicks, there was never a dull moment. Hilariously, at the very end, one of the dancers was held up high and christened as a salute to Simba in The Lion King.</p>
<p>Adding to the virtuosic performances is Eugenie Thompson. Her soulful cover of Amy Winehouse’s “Between The Cheats” (cleverly changed to Between The Trees) as a plea to her rebelling daughter evokes emotion and is simply irresistible. The chorus was soft and sung beautifully by a group of singing birds that both comforted Thompson and harmonized the piece. The brilliant display of talent exhibits Junior SING!’s greatest component: a plethora of individuals with awe-inspiring skill sets.</p>
<p>The scene cuts to the fox and a group of animals convinced that he is the real perpetrator of the stolen food. Maddened by her father’s willingness to frame her friend, she confronts Lou and transitions into a duet. Although the energy is high, there is something off-putting about the duet. Band does a great job with the musical accompaniment but it’s difficult to distinguish the song from a heated conversation. Due to all the back and forth movement, the song was shaky and resembled muted shouting more so than anything musical.</p>
<p>Heart-broken by his daughter’s disappointment, Lou realizes that it’s time to come clean. He calls for a meeting for all the members of Zooccotti Park. The members begin to ridicule Fox and tell him to go to Canada when a parka-clad Canadian runs on stage with an outstretched hand before saying “Seriously! Come back to Canada, eh?” But Lou stops them and admits his guilt. He abdicates his throne and the position, first offered to Fox, is ultimately given to Sal, the wise snake. Faculty Advisor Robert Weldon also comes on stage asking “Have you seen my monkey George?” to pay homage to the classic children’s book in a bout of comic relief.</p>
<p>What should have ended right then and there drags on with little to no justification other than a desire to fill time and allow Swing to perform. Despite having the honorary position of last act, swing was horribly disappointing. It suffered from egregious synchronization problems and dull choreography. The meat of the performance seemed to be composed of simple kicks and spins. The lack of confidence clearly visible in each member betrayed the presumably short amount of time that was put into the routine. Amidst a sea of wonderful acts, it was difficult not to wonder about Swing’s dissatisfying involvement.</p>
<p>By the end of the show it was clear that there was something about Zooccotti Park that felt a little like home. Whether you agree with the views presented in the show or not, the performance’s incorporation of a bigger idea than the usual happygo-lucky adventure story is original and refreshing. After a month of rigorous practice and planning, Junior SING! put on a performance that could have easily won first.
