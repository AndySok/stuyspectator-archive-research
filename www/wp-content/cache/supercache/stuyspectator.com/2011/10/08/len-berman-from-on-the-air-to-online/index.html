<p style="text-align: center;">It is easy to see how Stuyvesant alum and former NBC sportscaster Len Berman (’64) was a fan of the Yankees and, most of all, of “The Mick,” as he grew up in Long Island City, Queens. In the 1950s, the New York Yankees was by far the best team in Major League Baseball, and had arguably the best decade of any sports team in the history of professional sport. With rosters led by the all-time greats Bill Skowron, Hank Bauer, Don Larsen, Whitey Ford, “Yogi” Berra, and Mickey Mantle, the Yankees of the ‘50s were the proud winners of eight American League pennants and six world championships.</p>
<p>“The Mick,” Berman’s childhood hero and a 1974 Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, was one of the most dominant players in his day. Mantle’s towering home runs awed Berman as a kid, and in Berman’s book, “Spanning the World: The Crazy Universe of Big-Time Sports, All-Star Egos, and Hall of Fame Bloopers,” he wrote, “I’d wake up, and before even saying good morning to my mom, I’d ask, ‘Did Mickey hit one last night?’”</p>
<p>Though most of Berman’s sports memories from his early years were of Mantle and the Yankees, he occasionally went to Madison Square Garden to watch the Knicks or the Rangers. And while he mostly played sports in pick-up basketball and stickball games on the streets of Queens, Berman’s men’s softball team at Junior High School 204 won the Queensborough Softball Championship with him as the backup second baseman.</p>
<p>As with many current and past Stuyvesant High School students, it was Berman’s parents’ decision for him to go to the well-reputed specialized school in Manhattan. At first, not only was the academic work a challenge for him at the all-boys school, especially in math, history, and the sciences, but, he says, it also hurt his social development. “It wasn’t until I got into college that there were girls in the classes, so that probably set me back a little socially,” Berman said of the school, which only became coeducational in 1969.</p>
<p>Though Berman was not involved in athletics at Stuyvesant after being cut from the baseball team after tryouts, he did sing for the All City Chorus, notably at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. He also was part of Stuyvesant’s four-man barbershop quartet, which was coached by one of the music teachers after school.</p>
<p>Berman’s creative writing teacher, Sterling Jensen, who later helped found the Roundabout Theatre Company in 1965, was among the first to recognize the potential of Berman’s voice. After class one day, Jensen suggested that Berman consider acting.</p>
<p>“You have a nice voice. You should consider using it,” Jensen said in the conversation, according to Berman. That one comment launched Berman onto the track of his immensely successful broadcasting career.</p>
<p>“That was the first inkling that I could do anything with my voice other than talk on the phone,” Berman said.</p>
<p>After graduating from Stuyvesant in 1964, Berman went on to Syracuse University, where he majored in engineering. “[Engineering] was all good until about six months in until I realized how hard it was,” he said.</p>
<p>Aside from his academic work, Berman realized the potential in his voice, as he knocked on the door of the headquarters of Syracuse’s radio station on one of the first days of his freshman year. Though he first aspired to be a disc jockey, the position was already taken and even had a waiting list, so the radio station offered him a job reading sports scores. After Berman came to terms with the fact that all sportscasters did not have to be athletes, as he witnessed while growing up in New York City, where many former New York Giants players were sportscasters after their playing careers, he decided to accept the job.</p>
<p>A few months later, Berman was not only reading scores on the college radio, but also announcing Syracuse’s men’s basketball games. “It just grew from there,” he said. “I thought I’d just keep doing it as long as it was a good ride, as long as I could somehow find it interesting and somehow make a living out of it.”</p>
<p>From Syracuse, Berman went wherever an opportunity presented itself. His first job in broadcasting came from WLWD-TV in Dayton, Ohio, after he interned there during the summer after his senior year. He spent three and a half years in Dayton as a newscaster before getting a job at WBX-TV in Boston. There, he was the sports director, and he broadcast Celtics games on the air with Celtics Hall of Famer Bob Cousy for five years.</p>
<p>As a native New Yorker, Berman was initially not accepted by the Bostonian audience; TV sports critics hammered him in local newspapers. But he found it easy to be objective about other sports teams and left his Yankee fandom behind, partly because “Mickey Mantle didn’t play for them anymore,” he said.</p>
<p>Berman’s homecoming came in 1979, when he returned to New York City to work for WCBS-TV, and later WNBC-TV. He takes great pride in being the first TV announcer for college basketball in the Big East, and he had the call on many great rivalry matchups between his alma mater, Syracuse, and rivals St. Johns and Georgetown.</p>
<p>Berman especially remembers broadcasting one St. Johns-Georgetown game on Wednesday, February 27, 1985, for ESPN. In front of a sold-out Madison Square Garden and ESPN’s largest cable television audience to that date, the St. John’s Redmen, ranked first in the country, took on the defending national champions and number two ranked Georgetown Hoyas. Another storyline in the game was the meeting of two United States national team members and future NBA stars, Hoya Patrick Ewing and Redman Chris Mullin. At the end of the night, the Hoyas came out on top by a score of 85-69. “The excitement and the focus on [that] one event was incredible,” Berman said.</p>
<p>As the lead sportscaster for WNBC, Berman covered many Super Bowls, World Series, and even the Olympic Games, but what made him so well known by many people around New York, including just the casual sports fans, was his feature, “Spanning the World,” which aired monthly on his sportscast, and continues to air on the Today show.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1981, Berman saw a highlight from a horse race: “As the horses neared the finish line, the lead horse turned and bit the horse running next to him in the neck,” he said. It was these quirky and unanticipated highlights from around the world, packaged into a reel with Berman’s commentaries and the voice of Saturday Night Live announcer Don Pardo that made even non-sports fans mark their calendars for when “Spanning” would air. “It was half of what you found, and half what you wrote,” Berman said.</p>
<p>“Spanning the World,” along with the catch phrase that Berman coined, “And nobody got hurt!” enabled him to write five books, most of which were intended for young audiences.</p>
<p>He wrote “And Nobody Got Hurt!: The World&#8217;s Weirdest, Wackiest True Sports Stories,” and its sequel, “And Nobody Got Hurt 2!” to share some of the most memorable highlights he presented in “Spanning the World.”  Berman also wrote “The Greatest Moments in Sports,” “25 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time,” and “Spanning the World: The Crazy Universe of Big-Time Sports, All-Star Egos, and Hall of Fame Bloopers,” an adult book that included humorous anecdotes about players that were the faces of their respective sports at one time or another.</p>
<p>During his years with WNBC, Berman won eight Emmy Awards, and was chosen as the New York Sportscaster of the Year six times. However, being the sports anchor every day for the six o’clock and eleven o’clock news broadcasts did come with some difficulties. “The challenge was really taking a day when there were no real headlines and try to put on an interesting sportscast,” Berman said.</p>
<p>He often jokingly said to his peers, “The best part about my job was that there was another sportscast in few hours, and the worst part about my job was that there was another sportscast in a few hours.”</p>
<p>In 2009, Berman decided to move on from WNBC-TV after 27 years. However, he immediately started a new project: www.thatssports.com.</p>
<p>Berman has an “unproven theory” that “there are more non-sports fans than sports fans. But the non-sports fan is intimidated into thinking that he’s in the minority because of all the sports that’s on the air,” he said. <strong></strong></p>
<p>With his Web site, Berman appeals to the non-sports-fan majority with his daily Top 5. The five quick points or updates are about the previous day’s sports stories, or those to come later that day. They are written in clear, manageable terms so that even people who have not followed sports a day in their lives can show off to their co-workers in water-cooler talks.</p>
<p>The ideas for Berman’s daily update, YouTube video commentaries, and Twitter page all originated from The New York Times article “Finding Political News Online, the Young Pass It On,” published on Thursday, March 27, 2008. The article cited the rise of social media and networking, resulting in people not needing to look for news. Berman realized that people want the news to come to them. Now, with 140 characters or less, he can update his over 3,000 Twitter followers with sports tidbits in an instant.</p>
<p>Though Berman has covered sports since his college days, he still lives for the individual moments like Mickey Mantle’s “tape-measure,” 565-foot home run on Friday, April 17, 1953, which he remembers from his childhood. There was Tuesday, June 14, 1994, when the New York Rangers erased a 54-year championship drought, and clinched the Stanley Cup, with the feelings of “camaraderie, excitement, and exhilaration,” Berman said, filling the streets New York City. Or Saturday, October 26, 1996, when the Yankees won the World Series, of which Berman said, “Under the stands, I’m there with a camera, and [Yankees left fielder] Tim Raines was sitting and crying with his wife, drinking a bottle of champagne. Just a little moment like that.”</p>
<p>In Berman’s expansive career, he has covered and broadcast hundreds of sports events from around the country and the world. He said, “The everyday hum-drum is just a job, but then those moments come along that remind you why you love sports.”</p>
