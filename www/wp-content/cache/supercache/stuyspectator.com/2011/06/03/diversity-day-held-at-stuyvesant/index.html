The event focused on improving the minority presence and overall racial makeup of the school.</p>
<p>The event was organized by the Stuyvesant High School Black Alumni Diversity Initiative, an effort that began in 2010 with the aim of bringing more black and Latino students to Stuyvesant.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the daylong event, African American alumni members gave speeches reflecting on their personal experiences at Stuyvesant. This was followed by tours for the students and their parents.</p>
<p>“[Giving tours] made me really appreciate our school. Considering many parents didn’t know how to approach the specialized process, I was glad to give them that information, along with feeling lucky to have been set on the path toward Stuyvesant myself,” freshman and ASPIRA tour guide Savannah Jeffreys said.</p>
<p>Following the tours, a panel discussion entitled “Diversity at Stuy: Past, Present, and Future,” took place in the Murray Kahn Theater. Speakers examined the history of diversity at Stuyvesant, and discussed possible solutions for the steadily decreasing number of African American and Hispanic students accepted into Stuyvesant each year. What was once a 10 percent presence in the school in the 1970s has declined to about two percent in recent years.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant alumnus the Honorable Randolph Jackson (’60), who is the longest-serving judge in the civil Term of Kings Country Supreme Court, made the opening remarks. He stated that when he attended Stuyvesant, he was one of seven African American individuals in his class, along with a 0.5 percent Asian demographic. “It shows you how populations change over time, but the Stuyvesant experience stays the same,” he said.</p>
<p>With a more current outlook on the racial disparity at Stuyvesant, Xevion Baptise-Hall (’07) and Camillo Doig Acuña (’07) gave speeches focusing on the difficulties of not only gaining entry to Stuyvesant, but also attending the institution. Baptise-Hall remarked that she did not realize how lucky she was to take the Specialized High School Admission Test (SHSAT), and did not realize until her junior year the small presence her demographic had at the school. “I had an ‘Aha!’ moment,” Baptise-Hall said.  “I started looking at my classes and realized I was the only black student in the room.”</p>
<p>For parent coordinator Harvey Blumm, these reflections were the highlight of the day. “It was very moving to see however many primarily African American alumni come back because they care about the situation.”</p>
<p>Principal Stanley Teitel, along with Joshua Feinman (’80), Tom Allon (’80), and John Garvey, an education consultant, examined the problems facing prospective black and Hispanic students throughout the city.</p>
<p>Teitel focused his time on the High School Discovery Program (HSD), which allowed students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds who just missed the SHSAT cutoff for Stuyvesant to be admitted to the school. This program ran for years, but was stopped by Teitel in the early 2000s due to a change in Department of Education (DOE) policies by then-chancellor Joel Klein. “I was told I would now have to take students from below the cutoff for the lowest school in the Specialized High Schools,” he said. He added that these programs do not necessarily bring in African American or Latino students, because ethnicity is not the primary factor—a student’s financial background, parents&#8217; status of immigration, and other special circumstances are all considered in HSD.</p>
<p>He also attributed as major hurdles for underprivileged and minority students the inadequate distribution of information about, and access to, the exam. One program that tries to address this is the Specialized High Schools Institute, which is run by the DOE to give free SHSAT preparation to under-represented minorities. “Many parents are not aware about the test, about the SHSI program, or any of the other programs that exist to prepare for the exam. I think there are a lot of guidance counselors in schools that don’t even announce that there is such a test,” Teitel said.</p>
<p>Certain panel members affirmed that it is up to Stuyvesant to amend the issue directly. “There is no excuse, [Mr. Teitel], for you not to call tomorrow morning and get the Discovery Program back,” said Allon, president of Manhattan Media. Allon advocates the reinstatement of the HSD, a possible course of action that Teitel has said he would encourage, but only under his own terms, not those set by the Department of Education. In Allon&#8217;s New York Post article, “Making Stuyvesant a Place for All: Too Few Minorities Attend Our Best Schools,” published on Sunday, April 10, Allon highlighted the imbalance among the Stuyvesant student body and urged an equitable approach to test preparation, as well as modifying the test itself to better examine aptitude in multiple criteria.</p>
<p>Others felt that the DOE was responsible to push for change. Feinman, author of “High Stakes, But Low Validity: A Case Study of Standardized Tests and Admissions into New York City Specialized High Schools,” focused specifically on the SHSAT. Like Allon, he noted that doing particularly well on one section of the exam was weighted higher than having balanced scores on both sections, and called for a case study to examine the validity of the test. Garvey, who concluded the panel speeches, claimed that the lack of racial diversity “is a problem that requires a political initiative,” he said. He suggested that the DOE follow the Texas Model, by which top-scoring students would be selected from each school district to attend the specialized school.</p>
<p>The discussion was then opened up to the audience members, who questioned the speakers and voiced their willingness to devote themselves to solving the problem. However, many recognized that the disparity in Black and Latino entrance to the school would not be easily changed.</p>
<p>“It’s a very complicated and multifaceted situation. It has to do with mostly educational, but also cultural, social, and economic reasons,” Blumm said. “The most important underlying issue is that many students for whatever reason are not as equally prepared to make it into Stuyvesant and succeed in Stuyvesant as others are, and that’s something that the city as a whole has to address,” he said.</p>
<p>Those who look to further efforts on the diversity issue were encouraged to attend an upcoming meeting on Monday, June 13. Those involved in Sunday’s event were pleased that after years of acceptance decline for African American and Hispanic students, the causes and solutions were being brought to light and discussed. “There are many levels of the problem that need to be addressed,” said Michael Clarke, the moderator of the panel discussion. “This was excellent, and a long time coming.”</p>

			<p>If there was ever any palpable proof that affirmative action programs are necessary, it&#8217;s Stuyvesant.  </p>
<p>I mean, you have to unscramble paragraphs to get in through the SHSAT test.  That is the most unnatural act in the world.  ONLY kids who go to test prep programs can develop the unnatural skill to &#8220;unscramble&#8221; paragraphs.  It&#8217;s like people sat down and had to determine what unnatural skill that is not taught in schools could be put on this test to keep black kids out.  The racial demographics at this school are disgraceful.</p>
