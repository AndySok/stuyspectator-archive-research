            		<p>Located 15 minutes away from any subway stop in the Lower East Side, Bard High School Early College (BHSEC) is a public high school where 500 to 600 students go to school. However Bard is not a normal high school. After attending BHSEC for four years, students graduate with an Associate in the Arts degree (an undergraduate degree that can be earned in most colleges after completing two years) as well as a high school diploma.</p>
<p>BHSEC was the first school founded by the Gates Foundation’s Early College Initiative that was created to give more high school students the opportunity of college education. “I feel relieved about the two years of college credit because that means I can get out of two years of tuition,” BHSEC sophomore Nomi Zimmer said.	However, not all students view their college credit in the same way. BHSEC junior Noa Bendit-Shtull thinks that it is “fantastic that I will be able to save two years of my life and get into the &#8216;real world&#8217; faster. Being able to take challenging college level courses right at your high school is an incredible opportunity. It’s challenging and exciting,” she said. However Bendit-Shtull is unsure if she will use her college credit and enter college as a junior.</p>
<p>BHSEC does not offer Advanced Placement courses and its courses are not geared towards the Regents. It has a very strong humanities curriculum. “There are social sciences for everyone—they range from Creative Writing to Microeconomics to Modern China,” Bendit-Shtull said. Other classes include Chinese calligraphy, drum circle, story telling and rock ensemble. The four languages offered are Chinese, Latin, French and Spanish.</p>
<p>BHSEC’s application process is multi-faceted. The requirements for matching BHSEC’s “Admissions Profile” include an above 85 Grade Point Average, a score of at least a 3 or 4 on the city-wide math and writing exams if applicable (private school applicants haven’t necessarily taken such exams), and no more than 10 unexcused absences for the entire eighth grade school year. Students fulfilling these requirements are eligible to enter into BHSEC’s admissions process which consists of a writing and math examination, completion of BHSEC’s own admission form, and for those who perform well in both these areas, an interview. 	After having been admitted, some students are surprised to find that BHSEC has a more open environment than other high schools. “We hug and eat cupcakes with teachers, we have open conversations about sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  Everyone is very open-minded, even when it comes to non-liberals,” Zimmer said. “Bring up a topic and you&#8217;ll have five people to duke it out with.”</p>
<p>BHSEC teachers are well qualified in their respective studies. Fourteen out of 28 teachers listed on the school’s Web site have PhDs and a large number have graduated from well known universities and colleges such as Yale University, Northwestern University, New York University, Oberlin College and Columbia University.</p>
<p>Like many schools strong in the humanities, BHSEC has a student population in which 70 percent of the students are female. Some students are bothered while others view it in a positive light. “It&#8217;s less of a distraction for me and my schoolwork,” BHSEC junior Chelsea Sue said. “However my friends find it difficult to get boyfriends seeing as how (this is a rough estimate) 80 percent are taken, 10 percent are gay, five percent are shorter than you and five percent are just plain stupid.”	Some students think that the girl to guy ratio affects the way genders act both academically and socially. “Guys are nicer and less abrasive when they&#8217;re constantly surrounded by females,” Zimmer said. “It&#8217;s kind of a role reversal, with girls being the tough ones and guys getting angry over sexism directed at them.”</p>
<p>Regardless of the way in which it is divided, the BHSEC community is an active one. Students have the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities such as the Asian Culture Club, the Animal Rights Club, the Feminist Club and the school newspaper The Bardvark. 	Some Stuyvesant students view BHSEC’s two years of college credit as being pointless. “When I first heard about the whole two years of college I thought that was pretty cool, but it seems like most colleges don&#8217;t even accept these as credits so it ends up being a bit of waste,” Stuyvesant junior Rhiannon Mancinelli said.</p>
<p>Others feel that Stuyvesant students deserve the college credit as much as the BHSEC students if not more. “Bard is a small school, so it must have a much higher ratio of teachers to students than Stuy. It&#8217;s gotta be easier to do most things in such a supportive environment, whereas in Stuy, even if a teacher tries to help, they&#8217;ve got 200+ other kids on their hands,” Stuyvesant junior Nisa Beceriklisoy said.</p>
<p>BHSEC offers students several ways to shape their high school and college educations, including a unique option for students interested in both the humanities and an intense college-geared education. The school’s eccentric atmosphere and range of courses and extra-curricular activities offers a reputable shortcut to the real world.</p>

			<p>I go to Bard High School Early College, and I absolutely love it because it is very different from most high schools. The classes we take are very intense and not at all geared towards the reagents. In fact, all the reagents are viewed as a joke. Bard also offers not only a strong humanities section, but also a wide range of math classes including Calculus &amp; Calc II for Juniors, cryptology and financial math. I had gotten accepted to Stuy too but I chose Bard because it is smaller, almost everybody knows each other and it really stands up to to its name of an early college.</p>

			<p>I too go to BHSEC.  Clearly, The article is poorly researched because it cites only three students (All girls, and all of the same social group) and uses the school&#8217;s website, which is quite out of date.  In fact, 19 of 33 BHSEC teachers have PhDs.  Also, the first paragraph makes it seem like BHSEC takes four years to cover a two year degree.  This isn&#8217;t true, as the first two years are used to finish the high school diploma (which it takes Stuy students four years to complete) and the last two years are for the equivalent years of college.  Also, the Stuy kids interviewed don&#8217;t know Jack, because most schools do take the credits (including Yale and Brown.  I&#8217;m pretty sure getting into Yale as a junior isn&#8217;t a waste.).  Also, saying Stuy kids deserve more credits because Stuy is a harsh environment is like saying students at Cornell deserve more credits than students at Swarthmore.  I&#8217;m advising anyone who reads this article to talk to someone at BHSEC if they want to know what it&#8217;s like, and not take any of this article for its word.</p>

			<p>First off, kudos for writing an article far more balanced than I ever would have expected. </p>
<p>As a de facto BHSEC alumni, I pity those who might see BHSEC&#8217;s two years of college credits as &#8220;pointless&#8221;, for it is not quite the &#8220;credits&#8221; that matter as much as the &#8220;college&#8221; portion does. BHSEC is often wrongly looked upon only as a &#8220;shortcut&#8221; because of these credits, despite the hidden package that lies beneath, which is often unapparent until after it&#8217;s gone. BHSEC is far more than it&#8217;s credits, it&#8217;s a community of supportive friends and family who only want to see you succeed, as corny as that may sound. Despite this fact, I found my collegiate years at BHSEC devoid of the hand holding I had become used to, only to find myself trading it up for the indispensable qualities of self-initiative, responsibility and adequate humility. </p>
<p>Mind you, these opinions are coming from a student who, after spending 3 and a half hard earned years at BHSEC, became ill and ineligible for both my AA degree and HS diploma- Only BHSEC could have taught me that my acknowledgement my own self-worth, and of life itself, are sooo much more than those peices of paper- a lesson not many HS or college students can fairly understand these days. You haven&#8217;t learned much until you&#8217;ve learned how to learn, and more over, why you&#8217;re learning it.</p>

			<p>I am also a BHSEC student, and I completely agree with all the statements made by my colleagues above. In addiction, I thought that this article was very well written in terms of not really having a bias, so good job on that.</p>
<p>Nick is in fact right that a lot of great colleges accept all or most of BHSEC&#8217;s credits. But even if a college did not accept all or some of your credits, what you learn at Bard (be it knowledge, how to better prioritize with your time, whatever) cannot be replicated in most other institutions (at least at a high school level). That in itself is a reason for going to BHSEC, a school that I truly love.</p>

			<p>that&#8217;s a bit harsh, nick. maybe the website should be updated then. if you read the sentence, it says &#8220;After attending BHSEC for four years, students graduate with an Associate in the Arts degree as well as a high school diploma.&#8221; i think that&#8217;s clear enough. and please explain, what does this &#8220;jack&#8221; have to do with anything? it&#8217;s clear that you have a lot of school spirit and appreciation for your school though.</p>
<p>well, i&#8217;m glad that bard is a great school and i&#8217;m sure that it has very advanced &amp; challenging classes (of course the regents is a joke!) though some transfer out because of that. so many teachers have phds! it&#8217;s also great that as you say, yale and brown take credits and many students enter reputable schools. cuny, suny, and some private colleges grant two years of college credit (60+), but others accept less than a semester. </p>
<p>nah, i don&#8217;t think that stuy students deserve more college credit. (they can take some APs tests for credit.) bard is special in that it grants a college degree and that great college experience most love that high schoolers don&#8217;t usually get. students there undoubtedly do get a lot more attention with a 10:1? student:faculty ratio. </p>
<p>i believe that this is a very fair article that portrays bard in a positive light.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m a BHSEC alum. I graduated last year and am currently a junior. </p>
<p>This article frustrated me. I’m not sure why Stuy’s paper decided to write an article on BHSEC or why they’ve decided to write about it now. While I do understand that this was written with the intention of being impartial, a lot of crucial information was left out in this article, and I wouldn’t want anyone who doesn’t know about BHSEC to read this first. </p>
<p>Since BHSEC is a fairly new school, statistical fluxes should be expected on a year-to-year basis. The website’s inaccuracy is a notable flaw. In addition to the faculty error, the ratio of men to women is no longer as severe. I find it odd that the two Stuy students who wrote this article relied on the BHSEC website so heavily. If they had time to interview BHSEC students, then why didn’t they to talk to any faculty or administrators? These general inaccuracies, which are the fault of both the writers and the website, were far from the most frustrating aspect of this article.</p>
<p>What is crucial to understanding our program is that BHSEC grads are not given an AA Degree from a High School program, but that we are accredited by Bard College. Stuyvesant students may maintain their misplaced entitlement, however their school was not founded by the DOE and Bard College and does not have an equivalent mission statement. They’re not taking college level courses, but AP classes; there&#8217;s a stark difference.</p>
<p>Also, I’m put off by the notion that BHSEC is not competitive. While the admission process was accurately described in this article, it omits fairly daunting statistics. There were roughly 4500 applicants for the class of 2011, and 150 seats available. (Stuy students can do the math.) Though our community is arguably less cutthroat then larger schools, the assumption that BHSEC students are somehow less stressed because they receive more attention from their teachers is ridiculous.</p>
<p>“‘When I first heard about the whole two years of college I thought that was pretty cool, but it seems like most colleges don’t even accept these as credits so it ends up being a bit of waste,’ Stuyvesant junior Rhiannon Mancinelli said.” Spoken like a true Stuyvesant Student.  First, I’m not sure where you’ve gotten your information from, as I transferred just shy of 60 credits (and could’ve transferred all of them had I provided syllabi) and I know most of my friends, peers and upperclassmen have successfully transferred credits as well. Second, the belief that the only means of determining how successful BHSEC is is whether or not students are capable of transferring all of their credits is limited and quasi-pragmatic at best. BHSEC offers invaluable experiences to its students. We learn how to feel comfortable talking with teachers, and we’re thoroughly prepared for college level workloads. We’re taught how to think, speak, write, and read critically. </p>
<p>This article left out vital aspects of BHSEC, and limited itself to a crude understanding of our school.</p>

			<p>to explore other schools, i guess.<br />
you&#8217;re right about the stats&#8211;get the correct number from the school!<br />
yes, i think we know that early college programs are associated with a university that grants credit. you&#8217;re right that stuy was not founded by the DOE or bard college, but i would also think that AP courses are at the college level.<br />
the statistics about admissions should have been included here. i don&#8217;t see where you got the assumption that BHSEC students are less stressed. i don&#8217;t see the correlation between the number of credits and the level of success either (where is that expressed?); it&#8217;s true that the invaluable experience is what matters.<br />
reputable sources online say that some colleges grant two full years of credit, but some grant less than a semester.</p>

			<p>As much as I do not understand what the point is of Stuyvesant writing and article about Bard, I strongly disagree with a lot of what the article says. I agree with Stephanie, what the Stuyvesant student said about the college credits being a waste, is truly spoken like a true Stuyvesant student. Students at Bard are not there to compete for grades or to go on to an Ivy League school. Bardians are a lot more unconventional, intellectual group of students who are there truly to learn. Sometimes Bard is misinterpreted as being special solely due to the AA degree we receive. But students are there to genuinely learn and the AA degree is just an an added benefit, not the purpose of coming to Bard. BHSEC is truly special because of all the close friends you make and the social, non competitive community of BHSEC where everyone knows each other and all want to help each other do better rather than compete against their peers.</p>

			<p>I currently attend bhsec queens and while it is relatively new compared to the first bhsec, the quality of education and interest is phenomenal. Roughly 85% of the teachers have phd&#8217;s in their field and several have taught in renowned universities. The only complaint i might have is the lack of intellectual interest presented by some students. If you are interested in attending bhsec queens, please have a thirst for learning and contribute do discussions</p>

			<p>How is BHSEC manhattan? I am really interested in applying for that school, and I want to know what kind of people are generally there. What is the major interested subject? I love to write and I was just wondering.<br />

			<p>I completely agree with the other comments. Bard is extremely competitive, especially when applying. The teachers are great and so what if the credits can be useless? The A.A degree is still given and it&#8217;s not like you have something to lose. I kinda think that this article is bias, given that it&#8217;s written by a Stuy student, but not so much. As a sophomore to be this Sept, I cannot say how proud I am to be a Bardian :)</p>
