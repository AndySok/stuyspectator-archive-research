            		<p><em>Disclaime</em><wbr><em>r: This editorial is based on an ongoing investigat</em></wbr><wbr><em>ion. The Editorial Board has drawn its conclusion</em></wbr><wbr><em>s from the informatio</em></wbr><wbr><em>n currently available, and, due to the nature of the situation, this editorial will be subject to updates as new informatio</em></wbr><wbr><em>n becomes available.</em><em></em></wbr></p>
<p>Assistant Principal of Organization Randi Damesek was banned from entering the Stuyvesant building on Monday, September 2. She was told to report to a temporary holding space (formerly called “rubber rooms”), where she will wait while the Department of Education (DOE) prepares to fire her. This action came just days after a November 5, 2012, report condemning her and former Principal Stanley Teitel was released to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. The DOE is using Damesek as a scapegoat: her career is being destroyed in order to placate a frenzied media. This Editorial Board unequivocally condemns this decision. We call on Stuyvesant’s students and teachers to put up a united front in her defense.</p>
<p>Let us first make one fact very clear. This Editorial Board believes in strict discipline regarding cheating. Before the cheating scandal, The Spectator published a controversial survey (<a href="http://stuyspectator.com/2012/03/11/this-was-probably-plagiarized/" >This Was Probably Plagiarized</a>, March 2012), exposing rampant cheating within the school. We warned that unless strong action was taken, the situation would worsen. It did. Last year, we denounced the 71 students who were found to have cheated on the Regents exams. We urged the administration to take a tough stance. Serious punishment, we argued, would be the most effective deterrent to future cheating. We proposed a student-run ethics committee to publically handle cheating. We still remain open and willing to work together with the administration to solve this problem—a problem that will not disappear if Damesek is fired.</p>
<p>The accusations against Damesek are undefined and illegitimate. The vast majority of the DOE’s 56-page report focuses on Teitel, not Damesek. Where Damesek is mentioned, she is criticized for not remembering whether she made an announcement about the cell phone policy. Multiple teachers told The Spectator that they remember her making one, and we recognize that she has been consistently competent in doing so. The DOE investigators found that she “appeared to have little interest in the manner in which the proctors under her supervision carried out their duties.” Specifically, they called Damesek out for mishandling the Stuyvesant proctors in three ways: 1) The list of Regents proctors was continually updated, and eventually lost; 2) Proctors didn’t know how to react if they encountered cheating; 3) She did not hold proctors accountable for their diligence. These standards are unfair, because: 1) This list was finalized on the day of the exams, and all proctors showed up to their exams; 2) All teachers know that if they encounter cheating, they report it to their supervisor. It’s very simple; 3) How can an assistant principal simultaneously monitor 100 proctors for competence? These claims are trumped-up nothings. They are irrelevant and inconsistent excuses to insult an extremely strict testing coordinator. Damesek has a long-standing reputation among the Stuyvesant student body as an administrator who deals with disciplinary issues, including cheating, harshly.</p>
<p>In fact, the results of the investigation demonstrate that Damesek attempted to take the correct course of action. Despite her subordinate role to Teitel, she encouraged him to report the cheating scandal to the State Education Department (SED), which he unfortunately did not heed. This was Teitel’s decision, and she should not be held liable for it.</p>
<p>It is certainly worth noting that Damesek was fired after the report was made public on August 30, 2013, not when the investigation/report were finalized on November 5, 2012. If Damesek is, supposedly, such a liability that she must be banned from the school building, why was she allowed to run the AP exams last spring? Why was she allowed to run Regents exams and finals? Why was she allowed to run the PSATs and SATs? Why was she allowed to fulfill, just as competently as she always has, the countless responsibilities that keep this school running? The DOE has put itself in a double bind. If Damesek was “criminal” in her handling of the cheating scandal, it should not have allowed her work at Stuyvesant last year. If she wasn’t, then firing her now is unwarranted.</p>
<p>The reason Damesek’s removal from Stuyvesant has engendered such a passionate response from students and teachers (who have created a legal defense fund on her behalf) is that she is the glue that holds Stuyvesant together. She is the only top-level administrator who has worked in the school for more than one year, and she is widely accepted as the single most competent person in the building. In fact, only three years ago she won the Best Assistant Principal Award in NYC.</p>
<p>It’s hard to overstate Damesek’s role in the life of the average Stuyvesant student. She manages the school’s finances, lunch forms, AP exams, lost and found, SATs and PSATs, lockers, and SING! Just two weeks ago, she helped coordinate the smoothest Camp Stuy in recent memory. She is known for arriving in the school building at 7 a.m. and staying late into the night, dedicating all of her energy to a job she loves. This paper has stood opposite Damesek on many policy issues over the past decade. We have had our impasses: she was the primary enforcer of the dress code, and cellphone confiscator-in-chief. But we acknowledge that Stuyvesant cannot function without her. We are infuriated by the injustice perpetrated against her. The student body should not let this stand.</p>

			<p>I am a 1975 graduate of Stuyvesant High School, was one of the original editors of the Stuyvesant Voice, and was an active participant in the original SING productions at Stuyvesant.  I am writing to lend my support for Ms. Damesek and to share a remembrance of her and her family.  I got to know the Dameseks when I was a  counselor at a camp in the Catskills in the early 1970&#8242;s where he father, Morty, a highly respected NYC educator, was camp director.  In the five or six years in which I got to know and live in the same summer community with the Dameseks, I found Randi, her brother, her sister and her parents to be people of the highest moral and ethical character, with an incredibly strong work ethic and sense of responsibility developed in the Damesek children from the time they could carry a clipboard.  Though I was long gone from  Stuyvesant by the time Ms. Damesek joined the administration there (and I relished the opportunity to challenge administration policies while I was a student there), it strikes me as a significant injustice that she is being called to account in this manner for a situation in which it seems to me she was simply doing her job during extraordinarily trying circumstances.  And as much as I found it difficult to agree with much of anything published in The Spectator while I was a student at Stuyvesant, I completely agree with its editorial in support of Ms. Damesek.</p>

			<p>This is one of the best Spectator editorials I&#8217;ve ever seen. </p>
<p>The current administration will gain a lot of credibility and lasting good will amongst the faculty, as well as the student body and alumni, will if they ask Randi to come back as APO. </p>
<p>The current administration of Stuyvesant should fight the DOE for what is right and best for Stuyvesant.</p>

			<p>Maybe she cleaned up her act over the past couple of years, but to most students in the building over the past decade this is some well deserved karma being served to her.</p>

			<p>I am 2008 graduate of Stuyvesant High School. The firing of Randi Damesek is a huge mistake. Implicating her in the cheating scandal is clearly scapegoating in order to save the DOE some face in lieu of the retired Teitel. When I was in school, Ms. Damesek proved time and time again her willingness to help students in ways no one else would. On numerous occasions she came through for me and my fellow classmates. That beign said, Ms. Damesek was fierce in her moral resolve, and was always very strict about the rules. I know my time at Stuy would not have been the same without her there, and for the good of the school and students she should be reinstated.</p>

			<p>I am a 2008 graduate of Stuy and I must say I am thrilled to hear the news of Damesek&#8217;s firing, it made my day.  Damesek was extremely harsh against anyone breaking rules, and so it brings me much pleasure to hear she was reprimanded for breaking the rules herself.  Good riddance.  </p>
<p>I am not sure where the illiterate author of this article gets his facts from.  The full DOE report is available at <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/164289314/Stuyvesant-Report-08-30-13-Final" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','http://www.scribd.com']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/164289314/Stuyvesant-Report-08-30-13-Final</a>. Damesek obviously could have contacted the DOE herself, but she chose not to, as she worked with Teitel to cover up the scandal.  Damesek even tried to get the &#8220;ringleader&#8221; to leave the school by asking that he himself request a transfer on grouds that he no longer felt safe at Stuy (which needless to say was a lie). </p>
<p>The moral of the story is that if you&#8217;re harsh when enforcing rules, you  better be ready to deal with the consequences of not following the rules yourself.</p>

			<p>Agree with Anon. The report may have recommended Damesek be disciplined for her lack of coordination in handling testing, but I sense her largest transgression was forcing a student to transfer against his &#8211; and his parents&#8217; &#8211; will. That, I feel, is a serious offense and is indicative of many other lapses of judgement Teitel and Damesek have made in the past trying to sweep serious issues of concern under the rug. Stuyvesant may be a specialized high school, but as an institution that is free and public, it is still within the purview of the DOE. There are many good reasons to have the accountability systems put in place by the local and state education departments. To suggest the Stuyvesant administration and DOE are two different beasts, as some current students are claiming, is absurd. Sorry kids, you are not all as special as you think you are. Perhaps you should have gone to private school for that sort of treatment.</p>
