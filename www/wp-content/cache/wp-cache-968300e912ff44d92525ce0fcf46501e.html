<p>John Carlesi lives baseball. He has played and coached it for his entire life, largely because of the baseball family in which he grew up. To say that the game runs in the Carlesi family would be an understatement. Carlesi, who is the head coach of Stuyvesant’s varsity baseball team, the Hitmen, has an uncle who played minor league baseball for the Pirates, a father who played high school baseball and umpired for the minor leagues, and a family that owns a baseball camp in Florida<ins cite="mailto:Steven%20Su" datetime="2012-03-04T18:54">,</ins> which the Hitmen attend every year.</p>
<p>Carlesi first became involved with the Stuyvesant baseball program “many years ago,” he said, after assistant coach Matt Hahn brought the Hitmen to Carlesi’s camp in Florida during spring vacation. At the time, Carlesi was a coach at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, New York. Hahn contacted him, remembering him from the camp, and asked if he would be interested in running a batting practice with the team. Shortly afterwards, Carlesi was asked to coach the team because the former coach, Peter Bologna, decided to devote his time to the boys’ swimming team.</p>
<p>Carlesi had some big shoes to fill, upon coming to Stuyvesant. Prior to his taking over as head coach, the team had made the playoffs for 10 straight seasons. Nevertheless, he quickly fit right in, and has since led the Hitmen to the playoffs in every season in which he has been head coach. Carlesi has helped countless Stuyvesant students grow into formidable ballplayers. One of his players, Nolan Becker (’09), threw a perfect game in which he struck out every batter. Several of his formers players, including Becker, who plays for Yale, went on to play varsity baseball in college.</p>
<p>As a player himself, Carlesi played second base at St. Leo College, a Division II school in Florida. At St. Leo’s, in a game against Michigan, Carlesi got a hit off of the legendary one-handed pitcher, Jim Abbott. “That was probably the greatest moment of my career,” Carlesi said.</p>
<p>Carlesi also coached at St. Leo College before coaching high school baseball. “That’s how I try to run the [Hitmen], the way I did for college,” he said.</p>
<p>His favorite part of coaching is having the opportunity to teach and improve his players. “I like taking players that have some talent and trying to turn them into better ball players,” Carlesi said. Stuyvesant baseball players rarely enter the school as built or as quick as their competition around the city, but Carlesi has become adept at developing players with knowledge of the fundamentals of baseball.</p>
<p>“He is a big believer in tireless preparation, and as a result, our team is forced to adopt his state of mind,” Lubin said. “We&#8217;re obviously a spring sport, but we have a 10-15 games fall season, running from September to the end of October, and then we work out all winter, right up until the season.” The results of Carlesi’s year round training program are quite noticeable. After four years with Carlesi, players transform from lanky<ins cite="mailto:%20" datetime="2012-03-01T15:44"> </ins>students with a feel for the game into players to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>For his dedicated coaching and unique personality, Carlesi is beloved by his players. “My first impression of him was that he was a hard-ass, but he treats us like his sons,” junior George Kaiser said.</p>
<p>He works the players hard, but “as a result, our team is forced to adopt his state of mind,” senior and co-captain of the 2012 Hitmen Evan Lubin said.</p>
<p>A major problem for Public School Athletic League (PSAL) coaches is compensation, as they are only paid for a certain number of hours they work. Some coaches may choose to just work the hours for which they get paid, but “you can rest assured that whatever that number is, he&#8217;s exceeding it,” Lubin said. This is especially remarkable because Carlesi doesn’t work at Stuyvesant, and has to commute from PS 231 in Brooklyn, where he works.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I feel like all he thinks about is baseball,” senior and co-captain Kyle Yee said. “I would definitely say he’s the most dedicated coach in Stuyvesant, and possibly in all of PSAL. I believe his dedication to baseball rivals the level of dedication that the late Mr. Geller had for math.”</p>
<p>In addition to being a dedicated coach, Carlesi is also an incredibly receptive person. After the team started off the 2011 season with some early struggles, some of the players brought it to Carlesi’s attention that his “tough love” coaching style was not working for them. “We, as a team, brought [the fact that his coaching style was not working] to his attention, and he did everything he could to take note of it and curb his coaching style to fit our team better,” Lubin said. “It may not sound like a big deal, but I think it&#8217;s more than I&#8217;d be able to do, and even more so for him who&#8217;s been coaching by this style for more than 10 years.”</p>
<p>Carlesi is willing to do whatever it takes to help his boys. Aside from his work with players on the field, Carlesi is very involved in the college process. He talks to the coaches of varsity programs at the colleges to which his players apply and writes them letters of recommendation to give them the best chance to play in college.</p>
<p>Carlesi has shown extreme passion both on the field and on the sidelines. He has an incredible work ethic and passes it down to the players he coaches. He shows the same kind of commitment to his players that he hopes they show to the game of baseball. Carlesi’s message sticks with his players even after they graduate. “&#8221;What I learned most from Coach is do what you love,&#8221; Nick Gallo (&#8217;10) said. &#8220;[Carlesi] loves his job; baseball is a huge part of his life and he&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to keep that in his life.&#8221;</p>
