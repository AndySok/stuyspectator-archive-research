Add Facebook Like and Send buttons after each post. Automatically include Open Graph Meta Tags.


== Description == 

Add Facebook Like and Send buttons in your WordPress posts or pages. If the user is already logged into Facebook, the plugin display profile photos below the button of a user's friends who have liked the URL specified.

In addition, this plugin adds Facebook Open Graph Meta Data in your WordPress site to show the right thumbnail image, or the right title and description.

By adding Open Graph Meta tags together with the Facebook Like and Send buttons, you can get better control over how your content is displayed on Facebook.

This plugin can be the single most important factor in making your article go viral on Facebook.
