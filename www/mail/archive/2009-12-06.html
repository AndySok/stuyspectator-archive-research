<p><strong>Fires Continue, Planned &ldquo;Lockdown&rdquo; Not  Implemented</strong></p>
<p>A fire set in a garbage can on the eighth floor  on Tuesday, November 24, forced the third evacuation of Stuyvesant High School  in two weeks. A number of small fires in bathrooms, garbage cans, hallways and  stairwells were also set around the school over that period. The administration  has decided to postpone the implementation of a potential &ldquo;Lockdown&rdquo;  procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Per  Session Pay Frozen Due To Budget Cuts</strong></p>
<p>Due to mid-year budget cuts, per-session pay&mdash;the  money used to&nbsp;compensate teachers for the time that they spend after  school&mdash;has been frozen. The freeze will primarily affect Academic Intervention  Services (AIS), the Music and Fine Arts department, and all clubs and pubs that  require faculty supervision after 3:30 p.m. Teachers will no longer be paid to  tutor students or supervise extracurriculars after school.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibility and its  Rewards</strong></p>
<p>For now, the fires seem to have ceased. The  pandemonium of the incessant evacuations has died down, fire trucks are no  longer a daily fixture at our school and classes have begun to pass by without  interruption. What&rsquo;s left is a police presence throughout our hallways, as well  as a general sense of unease amongst the Stuyvesant community. On our minds now  is the question of whether more fires are in our future, and if so, what the  fallout of those fires will be.</p>

<p><strong>The End  of the World as We Know It</strong></p>
<p>At Stuyvesant, the Chicken Licken mentality is  common. In response to limited student rights, we often complain and direct our  negativity toward the administration. We form Facebook protest groups and grow  irritated when kicked off an undesignated floor. But then we promptly return to  our regular routines and remain complacent. This inaction only makes the student  body vulnerable in the face of future sweeping changes.</p>

<p><strong>One For  All</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;One for all and all for one.&rdquo; The timeless  motto of the Three Musketeers proves that the secret to successful group work  goes far beyond wearing matching tights. Many areas of life require a joint  effort to achieve maximum success. School groupwork is supposed to teach  students how to work together. However, the methods used to create groups are  highly suspect&mdash;groups resemble businesses on the verge of bankruptcy more than  pretend-partnerships designed to prepare students for later life.</p>

<p><strong>Not  Gleeful over Glee</strong></p>
<p>The latest television show to develop a fan  following of cult-like proportions, Fox&rsquo;s &ldquo;Glee&rdquo; is taking over primetime. The  musical comedy, created by Ryan Murphy, follows an eclectic mix of high school  students as they participate in their school&rsquo;s glee club. The show features an  ensemble cast starring Matthew Morrison as likeable teacher Will Schuester,  Broadway star Lea Michele as the ambitiously annoying Rachel Berry, and Cory  Monteith as Finn Hudson, the highly sought-after dumb jock. Week after week,  these characters must ignore the status quos of high school and come together to  save their club from dissolution.</p>

<p><strong>City  Harvest Canstruction Arrives Downtown</strong></p>

<p><strong>Opinions  in A&amp;E: Bread It, Just Bread It</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire&rsquo;s in their eyes and their words are  really clear. So beat it, just beat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This 1982 two-time Grammy winning Michael  Jackson hit song, &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; is an infamous tune. Even more iconic is the music  video, directed by Bob Giraldi, in which Michael Jackson breaks up a gang fight  and launches into a dance sequence. In addition, Giraldi is the owner of Bread  Tribeca, a restaurant located at the corner of Church Street and Walker  Street.</p>

<p><strong>Penguins  Repeat as City Champions</strong></p>
<p>At the Lehman College swimming pool on Tuesday,  November 24, Brooklyn Tech&rsquo;s loyal fan base erupted in support of their girls&rsquo;  swimming team, trying to help it through the championship that it had worked so  hard to reach. Yet the Penguins, Stuyvesant&rsquo;s girls&rsquo; swimming team, proved that  dominance needs no fan base. With a clean, thorough, and suspense-free 59-42  victory over Brooklyn Tech, the Penguins swam their way into a second city  championship in as many years.</p>

<p><strong>Wasted  Talent</strong></p>
<p>It is every athlete&rsquo;s dream to be able to skip  college and go straight to the pros. It is every athlete&rsquo;s dream to be making a  living by playing the sport they love in front of thousands of adoring fans at  the age of 18. Only a select few, however, can make this dream a reality. But is  it realistic to expect a kid who just cleared the acne from his typical teenage  face, after just four years of high school, to perform under that type of  pressure?</p>
