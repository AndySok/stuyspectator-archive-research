<p><em>By NICOLE ZHAO and BEN GARNER</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to try to stretch out the per-session dollars as much as he can by cutting back on the number of tutoring classes or cutting the number of teachers leading the sessions,&rdquo; PA president Larry Wood said. The donation will be made once the PA votes to approve the proposal at the monthly PA meeting on Tuesday, December 15.</p>

<p><em>By CHESTER DUBOV and SAM FURNIVAL</em></p>
<p>The SU organized the carnival in order to give clubs and publications an opportunity to fundraise. &ldquo;With the ban on bake sales, clubs have been unable to fundraise effectively, and the SU cannot grant all requests for funding,&rdquo; senior and SU Chief Financial Officer Rosanna Sobota said.</p>

<p><em>By SADIE BERGEN</em><em> </em></p>
<p>Arne Duncan, President Obama&rsquo;s pick for the cabinet position of Secretary of Education, used to play professional basketball in Australia. In fact, on election night he played a pickup game with the President himself.</p>

<p><em>By ARIELLE GERBER</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The freshman president and vice president don&rsquo;t really do anything,&rdquo; Zhou said. &ldquo;Nobody really needs anything because this school is already so good.&rdquo; Thus, they focused less on their campaign platform and more on making themselves known.</p>

<p><em>By SHILPA AGRAWAL</em></p>
<p>Over the next months seniors will frantically fill out applications and make decisions for college. However, most students have been making these kinds of decisions for a long time already. &ldquo; has always been something on my mind both because of the teachers here, and the staff here in general, and because of my parents,&rdquo; senior Tasso Bountouvas said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By LOULLYANA SANEY</p>
<p>I propose an equation that can be used in the SU&rsquo;s allocation of money. It would take into account various factors that all clubs have in common, such as the number of members and meeting days, efforts to fundraise for themselves, whether or not members pay dues, etc.</p>

<p>By SHARON CRUZ</p>
<p>The student body should hold the SU accountable for its mistakes and shortcomings, but it is foolish to blame the SU for budget issues out of its control. At the start of this school year, the SU possessed a largely diminished amount of money (as compared to previous years) to distribute to clubs and pubs. Due to its small budget, the SU should not favor clubs that already have a means of supporting themselves. While it is suggested that the SU should follow an equation to make budget allocation stricter and fairer, the money would still not be distributed effectively.</p>

<p>By DONNA KOO</p>
<p>As the year draws to a close and college application deadlines inch closer and closer, Stuyvesant seniors are giving new meaning to winter&rsquo;s long nights. Burdened with balancing their academic workloads and writing the perfect college essays, many seniors are up working at early hours of the morning. Bleary-eyed, they turn to the College Office for guidance, seeking advice on editing their list of colleges or keeping up with application deadlines.&nbsp;</p>

We&rsquo;re going to go with the dark horse of the race, the graduating class of &lsquo;09. These lucky alumni managed to escape just in time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By ANASTASSIA BOUGAKOVA</p>
<p>Between movies about beetles, barbers, chocolate factories and skeletal brides, Tim Burton boasts an impressive resume of dark and eccentric films. The writer, producer and director has been in the business for almost 28 years&mdash;his take on Alice in Wonderland, which will be released next year, is his 15th film. To honor his years of cinematic creativity, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) has created an exhibit recognizing the respected filmmaker&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>By ALICE ANICHKIN</p>
<p>American humorist Jack Handy once said, &ldquo;When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular heaven or pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but if it&rsquo;s not, mmmmm, boy.&rdquo; One of Tribeca&rsquo;s newest additions is the little pie shop located only one block away from Stuyvesant. Little Pie Company, situated on Greenwich Street and Chambers, is a tiny bakery, but there is much to be discovered inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By RITA KIRZHNER, SERENA BERRY, BEN KOATZ</p>
<p>Family issues are infamous for being convoluted, amusing and extremely frustrating. Families experience moments of laughter and happiness, as well as many of misery and hardship. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s most recent studio drama production, The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the- Moon Marigolds, presented a gripping portrayal of one exceedingly dysfunctional family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By XERXES SANII</p>
<p>The Phoenix, Stuyvesant&rsquo;s girls&rsquo; varsity basketball team, is just three games into the season and has already created excitement. In its first game, on Tuesday, November 24, at Washington Irving High School, the team won 45-44 in an overtime thriller.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By NICK HEIM</p>
<p>The Pirates are among the group of premier Stuyvesant athletic teams for which winning is expected. However, after amassing a record of 32-0 in the regular season over the past four years, the Pirates have found it difficult to finish their perfect seasons in the playoffs. Stuyvesant tiedBrooklyn Technical High School in the Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) finals in 2007, lost to Brooklyn Tech in the semifinals in 2008 and lost to Fort Hamilton High School in the finals last season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By PHILLIP GODZIN</p>
<p>After failing to qualify for States by falling out of the top four seeds during this past cross country season, the Stuyvesant boys&rsquo; varsity indoor track team seeks redemption. Despite being seeded fifth out of 75 schools in the city and winning the Borough Championships, an injury-plagued team was still disappointed with its results.</p>
