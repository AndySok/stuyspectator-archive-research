Hi,

I noticed a few problems with your website.

1.  Your search-by-date doesn't work.  I requested articles from
September 2001 but all I got were articles from 2006.

2.  You've prematurely updated your copyright date, unless
my calendar is way off.  This is fraud, albeit really pretty minor.

3.  A search term really shouldn't be required when doing a
search-by-date.

Best wishes,
   Dave
