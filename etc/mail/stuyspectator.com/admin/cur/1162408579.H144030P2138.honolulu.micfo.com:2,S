Dear Editor of The Spectator,<br>
<br>
I am writing to invite you to send a reporter to the "Brains on Fire:
How Gifted Brains Learn" presentation by Drs. Brock and Fernette Eide
scheduled for next Wednesday, November 8, from 7:00 - 9:00 PM in the
Murray Kahn Auditorium at Stuy. I also want to let you know that the
Eides would be happy to give a pre-event interview via telephone.
Please let me know if you would like to do this, and I will help set it
up.<br>
<br>
The Eides are a husband and wife physician team with a practice in
Washington state. Brock Eide is a primary care physician and Fernette
Eide is a neurologist. They are nationally known experts on gifted
learning and "strong advocates for neurologically-based approaches to
learning and learning differences." (See the "About US" page on their
website at <a href="http://www.mislabeledchild.com/AboutUs.html">http://www.mislabeledchild.com/AboutUs.html&gt;</a>.)
Their talk should be interesting not only for parents, teachers, and
counselors, but also for students. The Eides have spoken to groups of
parents and students, and have found that students often find something
fascinating about seeing how different brains work and are riveted by
the talk.<br>
<br>
If you would like to do a little background research to help decide
whether to send a reporter and/or do a pre-event phone interview,
please check these links:<br>
