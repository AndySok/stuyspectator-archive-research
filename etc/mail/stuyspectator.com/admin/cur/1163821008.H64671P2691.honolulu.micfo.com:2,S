Hi,
I am currently a writer for the Spectator and last year (2005-2006) I wrote an article in March about a Purim Party at Stuyvesant. I can't find a copy of the article, I seem to have misplaced mine, and I didn't see it in the online archives. I would really like to get a copy, it's pretty important to me, so if have a copy or any suggestions of how I can get one, please let me know.

Thank you so much,
Arianna Moshary
