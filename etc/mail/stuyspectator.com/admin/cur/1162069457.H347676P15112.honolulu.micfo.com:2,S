Well, for one, I noticed James' op-ed article has his name repeated in the
byline about three times.

Also, the "sayonara" and mr. dreyfus should be in features, not news.

The top is cluttered with all that text mike, take it off.

Lastly, we should really update the about section

BTW, I assume that in the future, when you click on a dept, youll only be
able to see the last issue's article and the rest'll be on archive. Cuz if
not, that's how we should roll.

Keep on keepin' on -
