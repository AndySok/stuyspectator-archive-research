Dear Spectator editors,
  I spoke to a few of you several weeks ago about The Spectator’s coverage of Diversity Week 2007.  Below is this year’s list of events.  We strongly hope that you will have a writer attend each of these events.
  Also, please note that the annual Diversity Week Talent Show will take place on Friday, March 2nd in the Murray Khan Theater.
  We look forward to seeing you there!
  Thank you,
              Diversity Week 2007 Organization Committee
   
   
  Stuyvesant High School’s Diversity Week 2007: Schedule of Events   
  All presentations will take place in Lecture Hall A.
   
  Tuesday, February 27th  
  Period 7 (12:25 - 1:08 pm): Filmmaker Andrea Simon - writer, creator, and co-director of a short discussion film called “Towards a More Perfect Union in an Age of Diversity”.  The film includes interviews from many people that address the basic question of “What does it mean to be an American, and a citizen, in an era and in a community as diverse as ours?”  The purpose of the film is to create discussion on issues of diversity and race in America.  Simon will discuss the links between racial segregation and social segregation with the students and present relevant clips from her film.
   
   
  Wednesday, February 28th  
  Period 5 (11:00 - 11:43 am): Author Judith Sloan - author of Crossing the Boulevard: Strangers, Neighbors, Aliens in a New America.  The book is a compilation of narratives from immigrants living in Queens, with photographs and other graphic art that contrast the portrait of the immigrant’s life with symbols of their American experience.  Sloan’s presentation will include a slide show and lecture about the creation of this book.  Sloan has frequently presented her work to students, even high school students, so she’ll likely be great speaker for us.
   
  Period 8 (1:10 - 1:53 pm): Reverend Judith Steel – an interfaith minister and Holocaust survivor.  Reverend Steel was a child aboard the St. Louis, the luxury liner expected to deliver 937 Jews from Nazi Germany to Cuba.  The ship was rejected and sent back to Europe just as WWII erupted.  While living in an internment camp in France, Steel’s father snuck her out of the camp and placed her in the care of a French Catholic family.  She assumed a new identity and was raised by the family.  Later, she was placed on a ship full of Jewish children headed for New York.  Rev. Steel will speak about her experiences and how they have inspired her work, her music, and her outlook on tolerance and diversity.
    
   
  Thursday, March 1st 
  Period 4 (10:10 - 10:53 am): Dr. Jack Tchen - head of Asian American studies at NYU.  He is currently working on an impact study with The College Board on Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders in education.  He describes this as the 'model minority problem':  how Asian American students have been represented as the "model minority" in relation to other racial groups, how it has affected public policy, college admissions, and it's impact on Asian American students themselves.  Tchen will be doing a brief survey of a few Stuyvesant classes, their immigrant or minority status and how it has affected their education thus far.  The survey will be given in mid-February and he will discuss the results of the survey with these classes during his presentation.
   
  Period 6 (11:40 - 12:23pm): Whitney Dow and Marco Williams - two filmmakers with the company Two Tone Productions.  They directed a documentary called “Two Towns of Jasper” about the murder of James Byrd Jr., an African American man who was beaten and dragged to his death from the back of a pickup truck by three white men.  An interesting aspect of the film is that Dow and Williams filmed the reactions of the black and white communities in Jasper using segregated film crews, each filmmaker with his respective race.  The segregated crews served as a lens for the film’s exploration of the racial divide in Jasper.  The film received considerable acclaim and was featured on PBS’s series POV.  This year, they will bring select clips from the film, discuss the creation of the film, and present the students with questions regarding the connection between the film and students’ everyday lives.
   
   
  Friday, March 2nd 
  The following two periods feature presentations from the International Center for Tolerance Education’s International Guests.  The International Guests are human rights and tolerance advocates from around the world who have been invited to the US for a residency at the International Center for Tolerance Education.   The format of the presentations will be a panel followed by questions from the audience.
   
  Period 7(12:25 - 1:08 pm): Jiri Kopal – a human rights lawyer from the Czech Republic.  He will speak about his creation of the League of Human Rights League (its mission and the inspiration behind its creation) and his research on equal treatment in education for children of minorities and the disabled.  
  Otilia Pacurari – a teacher and international consultant on educational policy issues in Central and Eastern Europe.  She has created the Third Millennium School Project, a pilot curriculum for teaching tolerance in schools.  She will discuss this work on tolerance education in schools and the Third Millennium School Project (its creation and her goals for the project).
   
  Period 8 (1:10 - 1:53 pm): Betty Makoni – renowned child rights activist and creator/director of Girl Child Network.  The network works to eliminate emotional and physical child abuse of girls in Zimbabwe and beyond through educational programs, advocacy, and community development.  She will speak about her work with child rights and the Girl Child Network (its goals, its programs, and the resistance it has encountered).
              Joao Silva Brandao Jr. – the creator of the Brazilian “Loose Tongue Project”.  In three Brazilian communities, the project teaches its students English and offers basic introductions to fields such as Law and Engineering.  He will speak about his inspiration for the Loose Tongue Project, his future goals for the program, and the impact the project has made on its students.
              Adeeb Abdel Rahman Yousif – born in Darfur, Yousif currently works with the Sudan Social Development Organization (SUDO).  Within SUDO is a “peace building program” that creates a safe place for mediation/reconciliation between victims and perpetrators of violence in Darfur.  Yousif will speak about Darfur - the genocide, and the cultural and political implications of what is happening there.
