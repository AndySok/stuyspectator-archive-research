I was reminiscing while watching some people throw a frisbee around and Googled the Sticky Fingers to see what/how they were doing. I was wondering if anyone remembered who/when the first Sticky Fingers were. I couldn't even tell you when the first posted articles were put in the Spectator about Sticky Fingers. Do you think you could post an article about the only Stuy team I can remember not called Peglegs?
