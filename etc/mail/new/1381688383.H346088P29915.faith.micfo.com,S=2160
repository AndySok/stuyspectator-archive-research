Dear Editor,

	About two weeks ago I attended the Stuy Spectator interest meeting. I found the spectator very interesting, therefore, I had signed up for a spot in the News, Feature, and Business sections of the Spectator. I was told that I would receive an e-mail with an application to be filled, and sent back in a timely manner. The application, however, was never sent. Thus, I am wondering when an email will be sent regarding the next steps and application for the Spectator. 

Sincerely,
Adi
