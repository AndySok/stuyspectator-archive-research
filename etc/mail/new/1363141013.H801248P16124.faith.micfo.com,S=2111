I read a blurb in the alumni spectator about the recent success of the Stuyvesant chess team.  I used to organize the chess club during my years at Stuy.  I'm interested in forming a Stuvesant Chess Club online on chess.com for students, faculty, and alumni to play together on a team.  Could somebody help me get in contact with William Boericke or a student on the chess team or help me spread the word to chess players at Stuy?

Thanks,
Joong Choi, '93
