Hi there,

Thought this would be of interest – in this week’s New York Magazine cover story, Robert Kolker looks into why students at top schools like Harvard and Stuyvesant are resorting to cheating. He talks to Nayeem Ahsan, the 16-yr old mastermind behind Stuyvesant’s cheating scandal, who tells him how he pulled of the cheating, the intense competition at school, and wanting to return to Stuy. The full piece is here: http://nym.ag/O8G0so 

The cover can be viewed here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ykevrxez73ffvbt/Sep24-12Cheating.jpg 

Some select quotes from the story:

Ahsan on the reason he got caught: “It was too many people with one exam. It got really big, much faster than I thought it would. One day it was 5 people, and one day it was 140.” Ahsan says he didn’t think Regents were as big a deal as SATs: “I didn’t know I could have gotten kicked out of Stuy if I pulled this off. That was never made clear to me.”

On visiting other schools with an eye toward transferring: “I just wanted to stay at Stuy more. Now I realize, but before I didn’t—you’re so lucky to go to Stuy. You’re able to learn. In other schools, there are kids in school who are texting during the day while the teacher’s talking. There’s no learning. It would have been easier, but it wouldn’t have been what I wanted.”

On whether he can handle the workload at Stuy without cheating: “I can definitely study my way out of it. Like, now that my future’s on the line.” 

On future plans: “I still won’t be able to go to a decent college. But hopefully I’ll be able to go somewhere. That’s what I’m worried about. Somewhere decent enough to work my way up into a career…I want to be an investment banker.” 

Former Stuvessant Spectator staffer Daniel Solomon says: “Not everyone cheats, but it is collaborative. One of my friends told me, ‘School is a team effort.’ That’s sort of the ethos at Stuy.” 

Stuy senior Edith Villavicencio on competition at Stuy: “Kids here know that the difference between a 96 and a 97 on one test isn’t going to make any difference in the future. But they feel as if they need the extra one point over a friend, just because it’s possible and provides a little thrill.” 

Kolkner writes, “[Stanley] Teital, Stuyvesant’s principal, used to like to share a quip with incoming freshman: Grades, friends, and sleep- choose two. The work can be so demanding at top schools that students sometimes justify cheating as an act of survival, or rebellion even.”
