Dear Editor,

      My name is Afshin Khan and I would like to know if it is too late to join the Stuyvesant Spectator Humor Section. I actually do like humor a ton and I was not able to attend any interest meeting. I realize it is unfortunate and a tad too late to ask now, but I would really like to join. I do believe I have a good sense of humor. Thank you for your time.

From, 
Afshin Khan
