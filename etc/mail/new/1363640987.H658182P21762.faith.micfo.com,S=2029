Hello,
Seems like the email addresses above don't work.

I'm from Stuypulse Robotics, 
and we've written up a press release about our victory at the NYC Regional this year. I can't attach it here, so please email me at steinmann.philipp@yahoo.com if you're interested.

Regards,
Philipp Steinmann
Vice President of Marketing | Stuypulse
