Knowji Debuts Unique Approach to Learning and Remembering SAT® Vocabulary

Palo Alto, CA (January 28, 2013) - Knowji, Inc. announces the release of a series of iOS vocabulary apps, including Knowji SAT® Top 500. Infusing great design, content and a smart learning algorithm, Knowji apps come with a memory coach and picture words to make learning vocabulary fast, fun and effective. The combination of these elements sets Knowji’s apps apart from all other apps.

Knowji’s vocabulary apps are based on scientifically proven methodologies, and present words at specifically timed intervals to ensure maximum memory retention.  Each word and its example sentence are illustrated with colorful cartoons and a story-like format that maximizes user interest. The apps also adapt to a learner based on how well the learner knows a word, so that learning is completely personalized.

“Many Knowji learners have reported taking only four to eight weeks to learn 500 words, spending just 10 to 20 minutes per day,” says Emmie Thomas, CEO and Co-Founder of Knowji.  “The enormous effectiveness of Knowji's apps is the result of five years of product development and refinement, and we are delighted to be able to make learning fast, fun and effective.”

For students studying the SAT, Thomas adds, “Students and parents often don't realize how easy it is to improve their SAT score simply by learning vocabulary.”  According to Knewton®, studying vocabulary can increase a learner’s SAT verbal score by as much as 300 points. Princeton Review notes “Vocabulary building is one of the easiest, most effective ways to improve an SAT score".  

Thomas recommends that SAT students use the Knowji SAT Top 500 app if they want to learn 500 of the most frequently occuring words.  If they want to extensively enlarge their SAT vocabulary she recommends Knowji Vocab 7-10, which contains 1600 SAT words.  If students prefer to build their SAT vocabulary gradually, Thomas recommends the Knowji Vocab series of apps - Knowji Vocab 7, 8, 9, 10 - each containing 400 words.  Learning at a casual pace of two new words per day, students can add 400 SAT words to their vocabulary in a school year.  

Knowji is offering 40% off its regular price as an introductory offer.  Knowji SAT Top 500’s sale price is $2.99, far cheaper than a deck of blank index cards or a vocabulary book.  The sale price of Knowji Vocab 7, 8, 9, and 10 is $2.99 and Knowji Vocab 7-10 is $5.99.

Knowji, Inc. is a Silicon Valley based social enterprise dedicated to making learning words fast, fun and effective.
