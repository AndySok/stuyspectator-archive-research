The Spectator strives to publish current stuy-related events on a need to know basis. However, stuyspectator.com does not reflect this goal. Journalist and editors rarely update the website. As an avid fan of the paper, I am deeply disappointment in the lack of attention given to the site. I hope that however busy and extracurricular-full your schedule may be, you find the time to devote the site as much care as the print copy. Thank you.
