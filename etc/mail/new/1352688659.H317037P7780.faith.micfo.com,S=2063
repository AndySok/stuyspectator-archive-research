To Whom It May Concern; 

I was reading testimonials of students affected by the storm.  I am a reporter at Columbia Journalism School and a Stuyvesant High School alum.  I am doing a story on people who had to evacuate and move in with family members and what that experience is like.  Do you know anyone who I might be able to contact?  Thank you in advance for your help and keep up the good work! 

Best,
Jen
