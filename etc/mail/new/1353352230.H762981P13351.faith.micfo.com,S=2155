Hey guys,

My name is Ting, and I graduated from Stuy, Class of 2001.

I am emailing to see if you'd be interested in using our "Stories" app for the Spectator's site (for free). Itâ€™s an easy way for readers and students to upload pictures and share immediate news stories - similar to CNN iReport.

We're in talks with NYU and several other campus newspapers, and I would LOVE to have the Spectator on board.

Let me know if you have any questions!
Ting
