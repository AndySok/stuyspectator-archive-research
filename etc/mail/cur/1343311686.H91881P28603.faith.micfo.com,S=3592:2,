OBAMA’S HEALTH CARE BILL HB 3200
 
Highlighted below are some of the most egregious pages of HB3200

**Page 50/section 152:  The bill will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally.
(this will cost taxpayers millions ----- or maybe billions of Dollars)

**Page 58 and 59: The government will have real-time access to an
individual's bank account and will have the authority to make
electronic fund transfers from these accounts.

**Page 65/section 164:  The plan will be subsidized (by the
taxpayers) for all union members, union retirees and for community organizations. (such as the Obama’s old "Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now" - ACORN).

**Page 203/line 14-15:  The tax imposed under this section will not be treated as a tax. 
(How could anyone in their right mind come up with this?)

**Page 241 and 253:  Doctors will all be paid the same regardless of specialty, and the government will set all doctors' fees.

**Page 272. section 1145: Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age. (At age 76 when you most need it, you are not eligible for cancer treatment.)

**Page 317 and 321: The government will impose a prohibition on hospital expansion; however, communities may petition for an exception. (What ?)

**Page 425, line 4-12: The government mandates advance-care planning consultations. Those on Social Security will be required to attend an "end-of-life planning" seminar every five years. (Death counseling..)

**Page 429,  line 13-25:  The government will specify which doctors will decide (not families) an end-of-life order.

**Finally, it is specifically stated that this bill will not apply to members of Congress.  Members of Congress are already
exempt from the Social Security system, and have a well-funded
private plan that covers their health care and retirement needs.

This information was researched by Judge Kithil of Marble falls, Texas.
