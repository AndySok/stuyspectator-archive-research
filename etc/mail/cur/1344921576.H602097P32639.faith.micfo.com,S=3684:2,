To whom it may concern, 


 	I am the author of “The Oculars”, a novel I hope you will consider for possible inclusion into your newsletter. “The Oculars” is a non-fiction novel, which takes place in new york, about a resented cop named Jarvis who stumbles across a secret society within the government, believing they have the power to become gods. Things take a dramatic toll for Jarvis when, in his quest to stop them, he ends up becoming one of them.  
	“The Oculars” will be published in late October. Directly following the publishing of my novel, there will be a book release/ publishing party and I am requesting the attention of the media. The Stuyvesant Spectator’s reputation precedes itself as a reliable source for domestic and local news and entertainment. I am requesting media coverage at my publishing party event November 17th 2012. I would greatly appreciate if one or two of your student/teacher journalist could attend my event. The journalist will have a great time and be recognized for their attendance while. The Oculars will be seen around the world in global book expos (provided by my publishing house) and The Stuyvesant Spectator will have been amongst the first to have covered such an event. 
	The event will be getting attention from most forms of social media by myself and attendees, including major shout out and publicity from Cuny’s WKRB radio station on 90.3 FM. “The Oculars” is published by outskirts press and will be available for purchase in October. I think this is a great opportunity for your staff and myself to collaborate. We can mutually benefit from your attendance. I am also more than happy to advertise my novel in your newsletter. I thank you for your consideration. Feel free to contact me, as I will need to make quick arrangements for the event.
