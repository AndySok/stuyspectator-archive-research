To the Editors,

As 1991 graduates of Stuyvesant, we were disturbed to read about the new dress code at Stuy and its purported uneven enforcement. 

First, the dress code is potentially harmful to the girls who are disproportionately sanctioned for violating it. Measuring and checking the length of girls’ skirts forces young women to take an observer’s perspective on their body, focusing on how their bodies and clothing look to others. Research has shown that such self-objectification to correlate with a wide variety of negative effects, including decreased math performance. Young women who may have been dressing to keep cool on a hot day are being forced to think about their bodies as the target of other people’s sexual desires.

Second, the dress code is insulting to young men as it fosters the view of them as unable to control their raging hormones in the presence of an exposed leg. Instead of making it a young woman’s responsibility to control male desire through enforced dress codes, wouldn’t it make more sense to expect men to be able to act responsibly?

If the goal of Stuyvesant is to create an atmosphere where young men and women can focus on their studies and excel in an atmosphere of mutual respect, we believe the dress code and the way it is being enforced is a hindrance, rather than a help.

Sincerely, 

Miriam Liss, Ph.D.
