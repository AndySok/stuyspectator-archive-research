NO COMMENTS FOR “WORKING ON SHSAT PROBLEMS”

Hello,

I was wondering how I might get my son to participate in this program. He was a few points shy from getting into the DREAM Program. He is not getting enough help from his current school and the tutoring I can provide is very limited.
Please, if there is any information you could provide for me, it would be much appreciated.
