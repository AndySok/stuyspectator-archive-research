I learned recently that a good friend of mine during my Stuyvesant years had passed away. I am sure that fellow students will remember John (Janis)as a fun and outgoing person. His obituary follows:

BIBELNIEKS, Janis Of Dedham, Mass. Beloved husband of Ruta (Subacs) Bibelnieks. Passed away March 22nd, 2012. "John B." as he was known in the Seafood business. He will be dearly missed by his family & friends. Brother of Zinta Lumborg of N.Y. Also survived by serveral nieces and one nephew. Funeral Services will be held at the Boston Latvian Lutheran Church, 58 Irving St (corner of High St) Brookline, Friday, March 30th at 1pm. Relatives and friends invited. Cremation will follow. Arrangements by Mann & Rodgers Funeral Home, Jamaica Plain. Guestbook at mannandrodgers.com
