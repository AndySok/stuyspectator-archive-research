Dear Editors,

My name is Larry Tung and I am a student at Columbia Journalism School. Currently I am working on an article about Bangladeshi students in specialized high school in New York. I interviewed a student and she told me that the Spectator published stats on students' ethnicities. But after surfing the website, I could not find any stats related to the Bangladeshi students. Could you please let me know if you have these numbers? Thank you very much.

Best,
Larry Tung
