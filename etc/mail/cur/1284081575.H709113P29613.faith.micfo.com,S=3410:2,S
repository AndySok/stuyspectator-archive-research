Many people don?t understand the effects misleading effects. I knew
what you meant. It can be more effective to give people little opinion
with facts here. I recognize this problem but with little clue, so we
must face the topic together. With new assurance, we hope that the
skill of other categories can be found together. Nice people can work
with great people, and great resource is important for us in analyzing
the case. I?ve studied for more than 4 years to analyze them, but the
fact still can?t be discovered. In order to do that, we must deal
with the changes of management resources. With so many resources here,
we can develop new ideas for solving to problem. Let?s give opinion,
let?s discuss them, we can take charge with our resources. The last
one but not least, I support your analyzes to face new one. With many
resources that we can collect, all of them can be handled well.
