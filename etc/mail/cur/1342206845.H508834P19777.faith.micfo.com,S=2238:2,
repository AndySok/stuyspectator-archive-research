I have a BA degree in political science and certif. in paralegal from cuny years ago that did nothing for me for any good job because of no exp. and age discrimination.
 Your students should expose how high schools in this very corrupt,cursed city illegally force algebra on HS students and other hard and useless HS courses that 99% of students will never use for any purpose in life and a major reason many HS students drop out and their future destroyed.
the know it all teachers don't give a d- - - and it's worse in college with other useless courses for some degrees totally worthless for jobs.
