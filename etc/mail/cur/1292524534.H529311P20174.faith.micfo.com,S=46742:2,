Graffiti Transcends the Streets

By CHRISTINE LEE with additional reporting by SHAH ALAM

Though graffiti may be considered an act of vandalism, it upholds the
ideals of art. Graffiti began in the 1960s and has evolved to become a

images.

The Corporatists and the Classroom
By DANIEL SOLOMON

When Joel Klein announced the end of his tenure as chancellor of New
York City=E2=80=99s public schools, an era closed for New York. The
appointment of Cathie Black as the new Chancellor is emblematic of a
poisonous approach to government that fails to acknowledge the
fundamental differences between private enterprise and the public
sector.

The Wrong Kind of News Bulletin
By JILL CHOW

At a recent Student Union meeting, I was disappointed when I learned
of a new rule stating that, due to cuts in the janitorial staff,
posters should be placed on bulletin boards only.

Rally to Reduce Apathy

By ANASTASSIA BOUGAKOVA
<http://stuyspectator.com/mail/lt.php?id=3DZUtWBVICWx1ZAB9QV1I%3D>

What with homework, clubs, STC productions, The Spectator and an
internship, I barely have time to get everything done, let alone
attend Open Forums or take part in the goings-on of the SU. But
perhaps I, and other students in similar predicaments, could make the
time if the incentive was strong enough.

Social Networking: The Best of Both Worlds
By TIFFANY PHAN

Social networking sites provide us with a shortcut to communicate with
friends after a hard day=E2=80=99s work at school and during busy weekend=
s.
To Stuyvesant students, these online social communities provide an
effective way to communicate with friends and keep our social lives
intact, while still being able to manage our workload and get several
hours of sleep.

How Now, Mr. C.A.O?
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

On November 9, Chancellor Joel Klein announced that he was retiring at
the end of the month. Mayor Bloomberg selected Cathleen P. Black as
Klein=E2=80=99s replacement. Whereas Klein has experience in education,
Black comes from a corporate background. A corporate CEO may in many
ways be ill-suited to effectively manage and reform the nation=E2=80=99s

Last week, New York City=E2=80=99s Department of Environmental Protection

Four Loko: An Appreciation

By JAMES FRIER

The hoi polloi may drink Four Loko merely for its blackout-inducing
blend of alcohol and caffeine, but I choose to enjoy the drink for
entirely different reasons: its complex and delicate flavor. To me,
each flavor of Loko evokes a different memory or emotion.

PSAL Implements Pitch Count Regulations

By SCOTT CHIUSANO
<http://stuyspectator.com/mail/lt.php?id=3DZUtWBVMLWx1ZAB9QV1I%3D>
 and EDDIE CYTRYN
<http://stuyspectator.com/mail/lt.php?id=3DZUtWBVICVh1ZAB9QV1I%3D>

In accordance with a new PSAL policy, pitchers will not be allowed to
throw more than 105 pitches per game and must take a mandatory rest
period afterward. The new regulations will place some teams at a
disadvantage against teams with large rosters and deep bullpens. In
addition, there is the question of how effectively the regulations can
be enforced.

This is the second straight year the Mimbas have failed to make the
