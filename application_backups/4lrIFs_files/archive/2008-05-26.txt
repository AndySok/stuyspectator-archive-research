Teacher Feature: The Grand Duke of Stuyvesant Physics
If you're taking chemistry, then you might know of theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli by learning about the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Simply put, it states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. But you probably don't know his reputation for accidentally breaking experimental equipment. Though he was not at the site of the accident, Pauli was blamed for ruining an expensive piece of equipment at the University of G”ttingen in Germany. Such has been deemed the "Pauli effect," which physics teacher Ulugbek Akhmedov uses to teach students about the apparently volatile combination of theoretical physicists (like Pauli) and technical equipment.

AP World History: Asking for Progress
"Why aren't you in the AP?" my history teacher asked me after reading an essay I had written. "Isn't this an AP?" I responded. I was somewhat confused. After all, the class was called Advanced Placement (AP) World History.

Arts & Entertainment:

A Supercalafradgelistic Show
The One-Acts Festival was moved from the fall to the spring last school year to prevent a conflict with the fall musical, but was reinstated to its usual time this year (a clash with the spring comedy created just as severe a problem). Now, the Stuyvesant Theater Community (STC) has decided to have two One-Acts Festivals each year, one in the fall and one in the spring.

From Rice to Rugelach
Although the 2008 International Food Festival's popularity caused tedious lines, the food certainly would have made Emeril say "BAM!". With dishes ranging from kimchi to rugelach, as well as endless ethnic rice platters, this year's International Food Festival lived up to its eclectic standards.

Sri Lankan Reggae Sensation
With his long hair, easy presence and Jamaican accent, junior Dimitri Wijisinghe could easily be mistaken for a native of the Caribbean. But this aspiring reggae artist hails from an island on the other side of the world-Sri Lanka.

Proving Themselves in an Unsupported Sport
Although some doubt their sport's legitimacy, members of the Sticky Fingers, Stuyvesant's girls' Ultimate Frisbee Team, practice intensely and strive for success in high-level tournaments. After finishing last year with a first-place win at the St. Johnsbury Invitational in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, the Sticky Fingers had high expectations going into the 2007-2008 season. Despite losing six seniors to graduation last spring, junior and co-captain Grace Lin is confident in her current team's ability. "We [can] fill the void," she said.
